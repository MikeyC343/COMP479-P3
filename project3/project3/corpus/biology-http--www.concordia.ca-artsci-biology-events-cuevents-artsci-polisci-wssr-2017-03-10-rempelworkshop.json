In this workshop, Ms. Rempel will explore the demands on the Canadian government when managing immigration and challenges faced when coping with crises like that brought about in the Syrian refugee case. What has Canada done right? How can we improve in the future? And what might be done to strengthen immigration policy to create a safer, stronger, and better democracy for all current and future Canadians?", "Join this lively discussion and find out more!", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Registration", "Join our Mailing List", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "WSSR Website", "More about Honourable Rempel", "Workshop Outline and Reading List", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Registration", "Join our Mailing List", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "9 a.m. \u2014 4:30 p.m.", "WSSR Website", "More about Honourable Rempel", "Workshop Outline and Reading List", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
