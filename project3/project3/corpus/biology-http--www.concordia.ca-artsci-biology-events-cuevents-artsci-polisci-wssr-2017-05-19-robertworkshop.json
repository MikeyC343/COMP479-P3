Through a deep historical understanding of the evolution of our Westminster parliamentary system from its very roots, this workshop will offer participants a clear analysis of the ways in which the Canadian Senate can act to fulfill its important role in Canadian democracy. Rather than throwing it out, Mr. Robert will explain how the Senate, through its representative powers, can act as an effective counter balance to the party machine currently running the Canadian House of Commons.", "If you are curious about Canadian democracy and how the Senate can contribute to strengthening it for future generations, this is the workshop for you!
