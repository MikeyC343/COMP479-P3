It aims to illustrate the kind of elegance and seduction that material refuse can take on as it reveals the finished product. A romanticized observation of the factory worker is portrayed through the bronze casted work gloves. The work is an homage to the materiality of mass production while recognizing the importance of the hand of a worker within these ultra-mechanical environments.", " developed from only two pieces of sold 1 \u00bc\u201d diameter x 12\u2019 length brass rods. Both rods were machined down into varying bi-products ranging from rings with hollow inner diameters of 13/16\u201d, to thin cut off rings. Through a horizontal drilling process that occurred to create the brass rings, material removal happened. This material removal resulted in the production of differing sized chips. These chips have been sorted into different categories of size, tracing the steps of production with clinical attention to detail in presentation.", " d\u00e9construit les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de fabrication en imitant ceux d\u2019outils ou de pi\u00e8ces d\u2019automobile, et donne sens aux d\u00e9tritus cr\u00e9\u00e9s durant ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s.
