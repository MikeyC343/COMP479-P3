In each artwork, consumer sound reproduction technologies\u2014microphones, speakers, amplifiers, headphones\u2014are subject to a series of transformations. These minimalist choreographies take a variety of highly sculptural forms\u2014superimposed acoustic enclosures, a curtain constructed of hundreds of earbud headphones, a surgically divided PA system\u2014employing a utilitarian aesthetic in their absurd transfigurations.", "The works play on the physical expectations of sound making, highlighting both the subtle ornamentation of unexpected sound and the resonant weight of silence. Through the redirection of both form and function, objects become part of a larger thematic vocabulary which invites us to examine both the objects themselves and our relationship to them in unconventional ways. As visitors engage with each work as well as the shared sonic spaces in-between, they can attend to the shifts in their own listening.", " r\u00e9unit une collection d\u2019installations sonores et de sculptures multim\u00e9dias, o\u00f9 des dispositifs grand public de reproduction audio \u2013 microphones, haut-parleurs, amplis, casques d\u2019\u00e9coute\u2026 \u2013 font l\u2019objet d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de transformations.

Pour r\u00e9aliser ces \u00e9tonnantes transfigurations, le cr\u00e9ateur s\u2019inspire de l\u2019esth\u00e9tique utilitaire. ", "Ici, les attentes concr\u00e8tes en mati\u00e8re de production de sons se r\u00e9inventent au rythme de l\u2019enjolivement subtil d\u2019un bruit inattendu ou du vacarme propre au poids du silence. R\u00e9orient\u00e9s dans leur forme comme dans leur fonction, les objets s\u2019inscrivent dans un vaste vocabulaire th\u00e9matique. Le spectateur est alors invit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire fi des conventions pour consid\u00e9rer non seulement l\u2019artefact, mais \u00e9galement son rapport avec lui.
