Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest.", "\n", "\nTargeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research. The long-term goal will result in an edited volume on the topic.", "\n", "\nFaculty and PhD Students should submit short abstracts of approximately 250 words.", "\n", "\nDeadline for proposal submissions: OCTOBER 10, 2016", "\n", "\nFor more information or to submit abstracts please contact:", "\nEli Friedland: ", "\n", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Biology", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Technical staff\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Job opportunities\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate programs\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate programs\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Weekly research seminar\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Research areas\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Recent theses\n                                                            ", "Student life", "\n                                                                Advising & support\n                                                            ", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Information for...
