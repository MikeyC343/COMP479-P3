How can creative reuse help us to alleviate our ecological footprint? When thinking of a life cycle for garments, \u201ccradle to cradle\u201d is often the terminology used to describe garment conception from fibres to yarns and then from yarns to fabrics. Once fabrics are produced, garments or \u201cend uses\u201d are described. \u201cEnd uses\u201d can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel. As a garment becomes mature and the product lifecycle expires, garments can be recycled back into fibres where the cycle is reborn and new concepts are developed.", "Art Hives\u2019 Science Shop presents UrbanBodies : an exploration of what matters in our everyday lives and neighborhoods.
