The name \u2018Vichy\u2019 soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by P\u00e9tain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city\u2019s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France\u2019s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de m\u00e9moire.", "This dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted \u2013 and often blocked \u2013 the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city\u2019s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism\u2019s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city\u2019s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy\u2019s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the \u201cCapitale d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019Afrique du Nord,\u201d Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-P\u00e9tain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond P\u00e9tain\u2019s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, P\u00e9tain\u2019s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de m\u00e9moire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.", "\n", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
