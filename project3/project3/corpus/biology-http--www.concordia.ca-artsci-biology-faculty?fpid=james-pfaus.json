I am interested in the role of brain monoamine and neuropeptide systems in sexual arousal, desire, reward, and inhibition in laboratory animals. I am also interested in the inhibitory and disinhibitory effects of drugs of abuse on sexual behavior. Current research examines the role played by steroid hormones, neurotransmitter systems, and cell signalling mechanisms, in the neuronal and behavioral responses to primary and conditioned sexual stimuli, especially those that induce sexual partner preferences. The neurochemical and molecular systems activated by primary and conditioned sexual stimuli are being explored using a combination of in vivo techniques such as microdialysis, and ex vivo techniques such as immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and autoradiography.", "\n", "\nMy research in human sexual function focuses on subjective and objective measures of sexual desire and pleasure in women and men, and how such measures are altered by different types of erotic stimulation. We are also exploring the sexual functioning of individuals under stress or with anxiety disorders.", "\n", "My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). I have also held consulting grants from several pharmaceutical and biotech companies, for example, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Lundbeck, Palatin, and Emotional Brain, to examine potential sexual side-effects of different psychiatric medications and for work on the identification of new pharmacological tools to treat male and female sexual dysfunctions.", "Tina Scardochio, PhD (McGill, 2015, Behavioral Neuroscience)", "\n", "\nLucia Farisello (Psychology - Cognitive)", "\nKatuschia Germ\u00e9 (Biology - Behavioral Neuroscience)", "\nM.
