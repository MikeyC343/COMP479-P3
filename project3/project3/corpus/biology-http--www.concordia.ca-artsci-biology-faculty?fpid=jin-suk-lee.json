We  study plant development in the context of gene regulation, protein-protein  interaction and signal transduction using the model organism Arabidopsis  thaliana. At the moment, our program aims to understand how different peptide  signals are correctly interpreted to control diverse developmental processes  including stomatal patterning in plants. By  developing a deeper understanding of peptide signaling that controls distinct  aspects of developmental processes, we plan to develop new strategies to  increase transpiration efficiency and biomass production of agriculturally  important plants.", "Plant Molecular Genetics ", "\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Biotechnology", "\n", "\n", "Lee JS", "and", "De Smet I (2016)", "\n", "\n", "Bemis SM, Lee JS, Shpak ED, Torii KU (2013) Regulation of \ufb02oral  patterning and organ identity by Arabidopsis ERECTA-family receptor  kinase\u00a0genes.
