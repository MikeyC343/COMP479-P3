Vincent Grenier\u2019s GBH research was published in the ", " he\u2019ll be pursuing his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, this fall, and hopes to work as a researcher in the biotech-pharma sector afterwards.", "Brigitte Desharnais\u2019 method for detecting small amounts of cyanide in different biological samples, including blood and gastric contents, led to publication in ", ". Desharnais, a PhD student and the recipient of a $50,000-a-year ", "of Canada", "Vanier Scholarship, is now leading her own project at the forensics lab.", "More than anything, a Co-op work term is an opportunity for students to learn from professionals. Kevin Louie worked closely with a supervisor to develop a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to determine if an individual\u2019s death could be the result of undiagnosed diabetes. This can play a role in ruling out other suspected unnatural causes of death, such as poison.", "\u201cIt is extraordinary when you realize that you work for such an amazing organization, and that your work will help in some measure to continue its excellent tradition of supporting justice,\u201d says Louie.", "Gosselin agrees. \u201cAt the crime lab, I was introduced to professions I hadn\u2019t\u00a0considered pursuing. I saw pathologists and forensic toxicologists at work, and developed a keen interest in both careers. There\u2019s no saying where I\u2019ll go in the years to come, but it\u2019s great to know that there are so many possibilities out there.\u201d", "The appreciation goes both ways.
