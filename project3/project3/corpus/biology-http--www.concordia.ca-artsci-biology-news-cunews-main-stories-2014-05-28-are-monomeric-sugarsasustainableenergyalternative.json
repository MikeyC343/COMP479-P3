Adrian Tsang, a professor in Concordia\u2019s Department of Biology and director of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, certainly hopes they\u2019ll have a role to play.", "He is researching how woody biomass \u2014 everything from agricultural straw to tree branches \u2014 might be converted to monomeric sugars. These sugars, in turn, may serve as the basis for things like biofuels, plastics and chemicals that will offer a sustainable alternative to products we rely on each day.", "\u201cThat conversion can happen through enzyme hydrolysis,\u201d Tsang says. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring how to do it in an efficient, cost-effective way.\u201d", "\n", "\nFrom June 2 to 4, the centre is holding the 5th Annual General Meeting of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada\u2019s (NSERC) Bioconversion Network. The conference \u2014 which is expected to draw almost 80 researchers and students from across the country \u2014 includes a series of workshops led by experts from the University of Wisconsin, BP Biofuels and the Dutch biotechnology research centre DSM, among others.", "\u201cWe\u2019re bringing these leading researchers here to look at what, from their perspective, are the kinds of advances being made and, also, in future, where the new advances will come from,\u201d Tsang says.", "Thus far, these advances have arrived in the form of new enzymes found largely in fungi and bacteria. Through those enzymes, these micro-organisms are able to break down \u2014 or hydrolyze \u2014 wood and other materials, and use their sugars to feed themselves. The key for humans, Tsang says, will be to learn to do the same.", "\u201cWe\u2019re working to identify the different combinations of enzymes they use, and we\u2019re trying to use these cocktails ourselves to hydrolyze woody biomass efficiently.\u201d", "\n", "Will our vehicles one day run on fuel fashioned from monomeric sugars?\u00a0Though it\u2019s possible now, according to Tsang, it will take decades for petroleum to be replaced completely. For the time being, he and his colleagues are focused on drawing these resources from seemingly unlikely sources.", "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop using energy,\u201d Tsang says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop driving cars. The question, really, is whether we can make everything we do a little more environmentally friendly.\u201d", "\n", "\n", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Lucas Wisenthal", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Lucas Wisenthal", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
