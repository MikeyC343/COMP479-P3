There are a number of concerns always, but from a genetic standpoint, small population size may not be as bad as we initially thought.\u201d", "For the study, Fraser and his co-authors \u2014 Jacquelyn Wood, the senior author who recently graduated from Concordia with her PhD and now works for the ", ", and current PhD candidate Matthew Yates \u2014 combed through empirical studies produced between 1980 and 2014.", "They produced an extremely thorough database that maps the extent of natural selection and amount of genetic diversity underlying traits needed to adapt to environmental change of 146 separate population groups across 83 different species, ranging from simple plants to large mammals.", "\u201cWe found little evidence for consistent differences in genetic variance, or the extent of natural selection across a wide gradient of population size in nature. These are notable results given the large size of the data set and the general lack of research investigating patterns of selection in relation to population size in wild species,\u201d says Fraser.", "\u201cOur results don\u2019t jibe with the widespread view that small populations should have lower amounts of genetic variation. We observed no significant effects of population size on genetic variance in our analysis.\u201d\u00a0", "This finding has important implications for conservation efforts, which should consider that the evolutionary trajectories of some small populations appear to be very much affected by natural selection, and different small and large populations of the same species may contain variation that is adaptive in a wide range of circumstances. What\u2019s more, minimum viable population sizes for some species may not need to be as high as previously thought.", "While this is cause for hope, Fraser recommends we proceed with cautious optimism.", "\u201cOur findings don\u2019t mean that all species are robust and can handle depletion, but it generally hints that there must be situations in nature that allow small populations to adapt to environmental change. If we can pinpoint which species can handle small population size, and even specific populations within species, it will influence conservation efforts.\u201d", "This study was funded in part by the ", ".", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
