But why yeast? That\u2019s because, at a cellular level, aging progresses similarly in yeast and humans. In both, the pace of aging is defined by a distinct set of chemical reactions arranged into several cascades. These cascades, which scientists call \u201csignalling pathways,\u201d regulate the rate of aging in a wide range of organisms.", "Using yeast \u2014 the best cellular aging model \u2014 Titorenko and his colleagues monitored how the information flowing through each of these signalling pathways was affected by \u00a0each of the six aging-delaying plant extracts.", "\u201cIt\u2019s known that some of these signalling pathways delay aging if activated in response to certain nutrients or hormones,\u201d he says. \u201cThese pathways are called \u2018anti-aging\u2019 or \u2018pro-longevity\u2019 pathways.
