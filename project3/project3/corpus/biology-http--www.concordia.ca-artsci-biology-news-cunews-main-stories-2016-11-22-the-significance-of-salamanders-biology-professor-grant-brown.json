Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population.\u00a0", " Salamanders are often considered the \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.", "Any animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can\u2019t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.", " Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.", " With modern molecular ", " tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!", " My ", " uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators.
