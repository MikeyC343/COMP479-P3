He\u2019s travelled to South Africa, the Galapagos Islands and Clipperton, a remote island in the Pacific Ocean \u2014 all in the name of shark research.", "From an early age, Leszkiewicz had a keen interest in nature and wildlife. While he was born in Montreal, his Polish heritage meant that much of his childhood was spent outdoors.", "\u201cPolish people have an affinity to nature, so my parents really instigated this passion I have,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom picking mushrooms in the forest with my mom, fishing with my dad and travelling to the ocean as a family with my sister, all of it had a profound impact on me.\u201d", "Leszkiewicz \u2014 who learned English by watching children\u2019s TV shows ", " and ", " \u2014 credits ", " magazine for spurring his interest in sharks. The publication declared 2011 the \u201cSummer of the Shark\u201d after a high number of attacks and sightings.", "\u201cI vividly remember standing on a pier fishing when a big bull shark appeared. It could have been 20 metres away from swimmers but it was just cruising around not interested in the bathers whatsoever,\u201d he says.", "\u201cThat incident made me realize as a young kid that they are not mindless killers, and my interest in them skyrocketed!\u201d \u201cShortly afterwards someone on the beach yelled, \u2018", "\u2019 and chaos ensued.\u201d", "Despite those seaside memories with family, choosing to study biology at Concordia was far from an easy decision for Leszkiewicz.", "\u201cI was debating to go into engineering. However, after watching the documentary ", " I decided to go with my heart and study biology,\u201d he says. \u201cThe university helped me a lot. I had amazing and passionate teachers.\u201d", "Leszkiewicz credits two professors in Concordia\u2019s Department of Biology in particular for their support.", "\u201cBhupinder Mangat had a profound effect on me in my earlier years,\u201d Leszkiewicz says. \u201cWe took the same train, so I got to chat a lot with him one on one! It was sad hearing of his passing.\u201d Mangat died in 2012.", "\u201cThe other is Dylan Fraser. His classes were always intriguing and made my last year the best. He ended up writing a letter of recommendation for my internship in South Africa,\u201d Leszkiewicz says.", "Leszkiewicz\u2019s 2012 Galapagos Islands trip was organized through the Concordia Biology Students Association. While on the island, he cut down invasive plant species and planted coffee beans \u2014 low profile work, he says, that fuelled his love for the Great Whites.", "\u201cVisiting those islands is a must for any biology enthusiast,\u201d Leszkiewicz says.", "He also saw Lonesome George, the last known giant tortoise from Pinta Island. At the time, George was considered the world\u2019s rarest animal because of his age \u2014 102 years \u2014 and the fact that he was too shy to reproduce.", "\u201cPoor guy died a couple weeks later in his sleep, so we were really lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is much to say about the Galapagos Islands, a true paradise unlike any other.\u201d", "In 2014, he spent two months as an intern for the South Africa-based Oceans Campus, helping a group of doctoral students in their research efforts. During the expedition, Leszkiewicz was a diver-of-all-trades, doing everything from filling water with bait to luring sharks with tuna heads to spotting sharks from the top of the boat.", "\u201cWorking out in the ocean each day on a boat surrounded by white sharks is definitely an unforgettable experience,\u201d Leszkiewicz says. \u201cWe had one scary moment where a female white shark torpedoed towards a tuna head we were using as bait and slammed into our boat.\u201d", "More recently in Clipperton, Leszkiewicz had a hands-on role \u2014 literally. As part of a team of scientists, and researchers, he was given the task of attaching sensory tags to the sharks for researchers to track their movements and behaviours.", "The trip was partially funded by Leszkiewicz\u2019s current employer, Sherwood Scuba in Montreal, where he works as a sales representative for the scuba diving products company.", "True to his European roots, Leszkiewicz suited up for the Concordia Stingers men\u2019s soccer team for the 2008-09 season. \u201cI\u2019m as passionate of soccer as I am of sharks, so it was a privilege to represent my school with varsity sports,\u201d he says.", "Knee injuries ended his varsity sports career yet have not hampered his passion for marine discovery. Now back in Montreal, Leszkiewicz recently embarked on another shark-filled adventure \u2014 this one a bit more under wraps.", "What is it? \u201cI cannot speak about it much,\u201d he said just before he left. \u201cAs soon as I can, I will let you know!\u201d", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Salim Valji", "Related links", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Salim Valji", "Related links", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
