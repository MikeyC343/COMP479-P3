The science of synthetic biology has the transformative capacity to equip us with novel technology tools and products to build a more sustainable society, while creating new business and employment opportunities for the economy of tomorrow. \u00a0", "We can now decipher the code of life for any organism faster and less expensively than ever before. Canadian scientists are producing anti-malarial drugs from organic materials that increase the availability and decrease the cost of lifesaving medicines. They are also developing energy efficient biofuels to dramatically reduce environmental and manufacturing costs, helping Canadian industry to thrive in the global marketplace.", "Put simply, synthetic biology applies engineering principles to biology to build biological systems that can benefit humankind. It takes the biological information encoded in DNA from one system and renders it functional through its transition and manipulation to another system.", "\n", "To realize the exponential potential of such innovations, develop them efficiently and deliver them responsibly requires an ecosystem of research and investment that crosses academic disciplines, the public and private sectors.", "Both the United Kingdom and United States have made synthetic biology a national priority. In January, the UK invested over \u00a340 million to establish multidisciplinary research centres that combine innovative science with industry training to form a new generation of bioscience researchers and entrepreneurs.", "The groundwork has also been laid for a Canadian revolution in the field. Canada\u2019s scientific community is internationally recognized for its leadership in genomics research and strong partnerships with key industries. Since 2000, Genome Canada and partners have invested more than $2.3 billion in deciphering the genomes of economically important plants, animals and microbes in order to understand how they function. A significant proportion of these funds has been invested in building the technological toolkits that can be applied to synthetic biology.", "But science cannot do it alone. Innovation on this scale requires multiple forms of expertise in order to be successful. Research in law, business, social sciences and humanities is vital to addressing questions of ethics, supply chain management, social innovation and cultural adaptation to new technologies. Industry knowledge and investments, as well as the capacity to incentivize entrepreneurship, are key to devising business models that will enable new products to thrive. Governments and funding agencies also need to do their part by supporting multidisciplinary research, training and infrastructure.", "On October 28 to 29, Concordia University \u2014 which houses Canada\u2019s flagship synthetic biology research centre \u2014 Genome Canada, Genome Qu\u00e9bec, the Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec and the UK Science and Innovation Network hosted a workshop assembling some of the major British and American players in the field. The goal was to learn from their experiences and think strategically about how to position Canada as a leader in this breakthrough field.", "Designing and delivering a Canadian blueprint for synthetic biology will take vision, hard work, cross-sectoral collaboration and money. The success of genomics research illustrates the foresight of committing resources to compete in areas with truly transformative potential. Canada cannot be left behind when it comes to tapping into the infinite promise of synthetic biology. The time is now to invent our future.", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: R\u00e9mi Quirion, Vincent Martin, Pierre Meulien and Marc LePage", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: R\u00e9mi Quirion, Vincent Martin, Pierre Meulien and Marc LePage", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
