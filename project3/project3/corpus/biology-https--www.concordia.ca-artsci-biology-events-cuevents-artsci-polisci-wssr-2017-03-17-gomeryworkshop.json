Gomery will review the laws and practices of Canadian Commissions of Inquiry and why governments use them so frequently. He will discuss the Commission of Inquiry which he headed, the impact it has had on government administration and the fate of some of its recommendations.", "In this workshop, Gomery will explore the ways in which commissions such as his can help avoid corruption and scandal in the future as well as his recommendations for better balance of power between the PMO and the legislature to ensure proper and legitimate functioning of our democratic system.", "Also on Justice Gomery\u2019s agenda will be issues related to increased demands by media and the public for greater government transparency. He will explore the ways in which such increased demands for transparency have led to a shift in power from the House of Commons to the media. But how will this shift in power assist in curbing corruption and scandal?
