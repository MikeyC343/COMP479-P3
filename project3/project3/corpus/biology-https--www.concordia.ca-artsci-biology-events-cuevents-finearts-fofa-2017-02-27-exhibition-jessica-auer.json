After spending several years following in the footsteps of the Viking explorers that first encountered the New World, the artist travels to Greenland where a team of Danish archeologists work on the restoration of the world\u2019s best-preserved Norse ruins. In this landscape, somewhere between the Old and the New Worlds, layers of history drift from one stratum to another. Stones that may once have supported a ruin now punctuate the walls of a modern house. Other stones, previously shifted to new purposes, are shifted back to restore an archaeological site.", "What does it mean to restore a ruin? The classical archaeologist is an investigator, parsing history stratum by stratum. Yet these archaeologists appear to have cast this aside, and, not unlike artists, embrace their own subjectivity and humanity, poking and prying, making edits, and exploring enigmas without attempting to explaining them.", "Se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant directement \u00e0 la \u00ab\u00a0d\u00e9couverte\u00a0\u00bb de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord par les Europ\u00e9ens, Jessica\u00a0Auer s\u2019inspire de l\u2019arch\u00e9ologie et des sagas islandaises pour examiner cette \u00e9nigme historique. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs ann\u00e9es \u00e0 suivre les traces des premiers explorateurs vikings qui ont foul\u00e9 le sol du Nouveau Monde, l\u2019artiste s\u2019est rendue au Groenland pour rejoindre une \u00e9quipe d\u2019arch\u00e9ologues danois \u0153uvrant \u00e0 la restauration des ruines des colonies nordiques les mieux pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es du monde. Dans ce paysage \u00e0 mi-chemin entre l\u2019Ancien et le Nouveau Monde, l\u2019histoire se r\u00e9v\u00e8le au fil des strates qu\u2019elle parcourt. Des pierres pouvant avoir servi de fondation dans une construction ancienne sont aujourd\u2019hui int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans les murs d\u2019une maison moderne. D\u2019autres pierres ainsi d\u00e9tourn\u00e9es il y a longtemps de leur fonction initiale sont r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9es pour la restauration d\u2019un site arch\u00e9ologique.  ", "Que signifie \u00ab\u00a0restaurer une ruine\u00a0\u00bb? Les arch\u00e9ologues classiques sont des chercheurs qui analysent les couches de l\u2019histoire une \u00e0 une. Or, ils semblent avoir mis ce travail de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des artistes, en \u00eatre venus \u00e0 accepter leur subjectivit\u00e9 et leur humanit\u00e9. Ils fouillent, apportent des changements et sondent les myst\u00e8res sans tenter de les expliquer. ", " is a photographer and visual artist from Montreal.
