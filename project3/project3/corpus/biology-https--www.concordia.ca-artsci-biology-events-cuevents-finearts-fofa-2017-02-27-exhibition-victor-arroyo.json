Riots broke out the next day, and with that, a social movement wass born: the Montreal Nord Affaire. The killing of Fredy Villanueva not only stirred up years of social exclusion and discontent, but also brought visibility to current tactics of police surveillance, institutional power asymmetries and racial profiling. Montr\u00e9al Nord operates under the gaze of power; security and surveillance cameras, CCTV, Google Maps and Google street view\u2014all employ a vertical glance operated by assorted asymmetrical institutional mechanisms, forging composite vertical views. These mechanisms act in ambiguous and invisible ways, much like how social exclusion co-exists among uneven representation of the marginalized. Victor Arroyo documented the Montral Nord grassroots movement and their sites of resistance with a surveillance camera, mirroring tactics of surveillance. His work ", "seeks to rupture the unidirectional nature of the gaze, transforming surveillance into a dynamic relationship, while undermining the distinction between the watchers and the watched.", "Le soir du 9\u00a0ao\u00fbt\u00a02008, Fredy\u00a0Villanueva a \u00e9t\u00e9 abattu par le policier Jean-Loup\u00a0Lapointe \u00e0 l\u2019ar\u00e9na Henri-Bourassa, dans l\u2019arrondissement de Montr\u00e9al-Nord.

Le meurtre de Fredy\u00a0Villanueva a non seulement attis\u00e9 le sentiment d\u2019exclusion sociale et le m\u00e9contentement qui sommeillaient depuis des ann\u00e9es, mais aussi mis en lumi\u00e8re les tactiques de surveillance polici\u00e8re actuelles, l\u2019asym\u00e9trie des pouvoirs institutionnels et le profilage racial.

His work is concerned with the changing nature of revolutionary praxis, or what is often referred to as political and activist art. Arroyo is also interested in material culture, landscape and identity through the critical lens of postmodern geography, specifically notions of discursive diasporas, geographies of exclusion and structural violence. His research and practice engages with the disappearance of personal and collective memory and how, through political and activist art, novel configurations of memory can be re-instituted.
