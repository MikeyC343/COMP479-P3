Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people\u2019s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation. Yes, the exhibition is about dads\u2014dead dads at that\u2014but it is also a rumination on memory and the size and viscosity of memory. A vague longing.", "Donna\u00a0Akrey et Yvette\u00a0Poorter collaborent, au gr\u00e9 de leur disponibilit\u00e9, depuis les ann\u00e9es\u00a01990 (ou depuis qu\u2019elles ont saut\u00e9 d\u2019une falaise dans les eaux de Muskoka \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 17\u00a0ans). Leur \u0153uvre multim\u00e9dia fait souvent appel \u00e0 des mat\u00e9riaux facilement trouv\u00e9s ou r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s. Bien qu\u2019elles souhaitent pouvoir se perdre, elles r\u00e9alisent la raret\u00e9 d\u2019une telle possibilit\u00e9 et cherchent donc plut\u00f4t \u00e0 se perdre dans leurs cr\u00e9ations. Le duo recueille des r\u00e9cits et des images de personnes dont le p\u00e8re est mort. Elles se servent de ces fragments de souvenirs d\u2019autrui pour concevoir une installation paysag\u00e8re \u00e9volutive.
