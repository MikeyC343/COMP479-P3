Due to the advancement of the internet, consumers were now able to download music for free on peer-to-peer (P2P) filesharing networks.", "Record labels and industry executives were initially skeptical that these sites would remain popular, and it is this ignorance which led to a dramatic decline in music sales over the last decade.", "As a result, the importance of record companies has diminished, and artists now face challenges in creating awareness for themselves in an industry where barriers to distributing music have significantly lowered.", "For consumers, these changes from internet technologies are often seen to have had \u201cdemocratizing\u201d effects; however, consumers face new challenges in determining what music to listen to, and the industry continues to experiment with new methods of distributing content to consumers in an attempt to \u201cre-monetize\u201d music consumption.", "Complimentary.", "Webinar link will be provided upon registration.", "Zack Krastel is an alumnus of Concordia (MSc) and McGill (BMus, BA) universities, and is currently a PhD student in Marketing at the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University.", "Zack is interested in how changes in technology, social influences and behavioural research can help to explain consumption behaviour and preferences in the music industry.", "This research has been conducted from the perspective of the consumer and the music industry, with topics ranging from individual consumption patterns to website design and technology use.", "He is a member of the Association for Information Systems (AIS) and American Marketing Association (AMA), and regularly presents his work at international academic conferences and seminars.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Monday, December 12, 2016", "Register", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Monday, December 12, 2016", "Register", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
