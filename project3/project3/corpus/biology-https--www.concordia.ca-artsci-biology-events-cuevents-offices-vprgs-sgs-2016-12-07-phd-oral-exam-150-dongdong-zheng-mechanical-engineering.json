These systems are usually labeled as \u201csingularly perturbed\u201d or \u201cmulti-time-scale\u201d systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities.", "To obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight\u2019s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises.", "Based on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems \u2013 the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Biology", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Technical staff\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Job opportunities\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate programs\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate programs\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Weekly research seminar\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Research areas\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Recent theses\n                                                            ", "Student life", "\n                                                                Advising & support\n                                                            ", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Information for...
