This international curatorial internship will bridge two cultural regions through the development of an exhibition program that will introduce artists from Mexico City to the Montreal cultural community. As curatorial ambassador, Belshaw will begin the internship at SOMA, a non-profit organization conceived to nurture discussion and exchange in the field of contemporary art and education in Mexico City. She will conclude the internship at the FOFA Gallery, working with the research produced during her time in Mexico.", "The killing of Freddy Villanueva on August 9, 2008 by police officer Jean-Loup Lapointe at the Henri-Bourassa Arena in the Montreal Nord area brought visibility to issues of police surveillance, institutional power asymmetries and racial profiling. For his exhibition 'MTL Nord', Victor Arroyo used counter-surveillance video to reflect on relationships between identity, site, history, and memory. Arroyo\u2019s work seeks to challenge institutional power asymmetries in documentary practices at the intersection of everyday life, site-specific issues of social justice, and political oppression.", "Natalie Nadeau's exhibition 'Chip Production' deconstructs manufacturing processes, emulating that of tool die or auto part production, and gives significance to the waste that is created during these processes. It aims to illustrate the kind of elegance and seduction that material refuse can take on as it reveals the finished product. A romanticized observation of the factory worker is portrayed through the bronze casted work gloves. The work is an homage to the materiality of mass production while recognizing the importance of the hand of a worker within these ultra-mechanical environments.
