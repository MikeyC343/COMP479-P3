We are in the midst of a scientific revolution; major discoveries continue to be made that change the way we think about traditional scientific subjects. By using a combination of traditional and outside-the-box teaching methods I try to inspire students to learn not just for the sake of learning but because they are inspired by the material. My lectures aim to blend \u2018textbook facts\u2019 with new information. In this way the students will leave Concordia with a cutting edge knowledge base and way of thinking that will help them succeed in whatever endeavor they pursue.\u201d", "EXCI461 Pharmacology for Sport and Exercise ", "\nEXCI257 Physiology (Endocrinology)", "Our research area is immunology, with an emphasis on how the immune system and autonomic nervous system communicate with each other. The main project called \"Hormonal regulation of T cell Genomics.\", is meant to investigate how the catecholamine hormone receptors (e.g. beta2-adrenergic receptor) influence T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Other hormones of interest include thyroid hormones and cortisol. A second project called \"Human variations in sympathetic nervous system response.\" was recently launched to address the hypothesis that human autonomic traits are distributed around two theoretical groupings. For this project, human subjects listen to dissonant music or undergo cold exposure to induce autonomic reactions. A third initiative is in development to investigate the impact of sodium on T lymphocyte responses in people. Dr. Darlington always encourages students to develop and pursue their own research interests within the themes of immunology and autonomic nervous system. The research happens in Canada at the PERFORM Centre and the Center for Structural and Functional Genomics at the Loyola Campus in NDG, Montreal, Quebec.\u00a0 ", "\n", "1.", "A. Rozenberg, A.
