That\u2019s a good thing since Guerrieri, who is graduating with a specialization in women\u2019s studies, aspires to work in the humanitarian field \u2014 though she\u2019s not sure yet in what exact capacity.", "\n", "\u201cI would need to be front line, to see and feel any changes,\u201d says Guerrieri. \u201cBecause of the focus of my activist work, I see myself working primarily with women, queer communities or youth.\u201d", "\n", "\nSince moving to Montreal three years ago to attend Concordia, Guerrieri has served on the Tribunal Hearing Pool in Concordia\u2019s Office of Student Tribunals, heard cases involving Academic Code of Conduct charges and volunteered with the Social Justice Committee of Montreal, an independent human rights organization. At the same time, she\u2019s maintained grades that have kept her on the Dean\u2019s List.", "\n", "\n\u201cThe biggest thing I will take from my experience at Concordia, from my activities and studies, is meeting so many different people who have inspired me to think differently,\u201d Guerrieri says. \u201cBy being active in different fields, I was able to keep my mind open to different points of view.\u201d", "\n", "\nShe plans to continue with graduate studies at some point. But for now, the Italian-born social activist wants to focus on improving her French: Guerrieri intends to apply to stay in Quebec through the Programme de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.", "\n", "\n", "\nWhile her professors enriched her academic knowledge, Sophie Kr\u00e4uchi credits her fellow students with inspiring her during her undergraduate years.", "\n", "\n\u201cConcordia\u2019s dynamic institution stems from the passions of its students and this is what has really helped me to flourish,\u201d says the new BA with Honours in Sociology graduate.", "\n", "\nKr\u00e4uchi, who will continue with master\u2019s studies in international development in her Swiss hometown\u2019s University of Geneva, only got involved in student life after her first year left her feeling there was more to university than attending class and doing homework.", "\n", "\nTwo events then unleashed her potential. The first was an invitation to join Concordia\u2019s chapter of the Golden Key International Honour Society, which led to her serving on the executive team. The second event was a trip to Ecuador with United to Benefit Ecuadorian Children, International, an organization that helps children and youth build a better future for themselves.", "\n", "\n\u201cI came to understand, in the famous words of anthropologist Margaret Mead, \u2018that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world,\u2019 \u201d Kr\u00e4uchi writes in an email.", "\n", "\nSince then, she has been involved with the Casa Cares annual charity fashion show, the Sociology and Anthropology Students\u2019 Association, Humanitarian Awareness Concordia University, and in developing the Concordia chapter of World University Service of Canada.", "\n", "\nHer efforts were recognized in April with Concordia\u2019s Arts and Science Federation of Associations\u2019 Outstanding Contribution to Student Life Award.", "\n", "\n\u201cFinding equilibrium between studies, work and socializing is tough, but adding the volunteering aspect was key,\u201d says Kr\u00e4uchi. \u201cGiving back doesn\u2019t need to be time-consuming or expensive. It just needs to be meaningful.\u201d", "\n", "\n", "\nSevan Mattie recalls the most important moment of his time at Concordia. It happened during an English course in his first term, when the professor told the class to notice things actively. For Mattie, this concentrated focus allowed him to question more deeply.", "\n", "\n\u201cThat advice changed how I learned,\u201d says Mattie, a native of Iraq who is graduating with a BSc with Honours in Biology \u2014 and two articles published in scientific journals, Yeast and Aging.", "\n", "\nParticularly interested in how we grow older, he\u2019s been researching mitochondria and its role in the aging process. He received an undergraduate research award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada as well as a training award from the Fonds de recherche en sant\u00e9 du Quebec, among others, to help advance his studies.", "\n", "\nHe\u2019s also a member of the Concordia Science College and, with a 4.22 GPA, of the Golden Key International Honour Society.", "\n", "\nAt Concordia, Mattie has been particularly impressed by the level of interaction between students and professors, calling this \u201cone of the qualities at which Concordia excels. You\u2019re not lost in an ocean of students.\u201d", "\n", "\nThis fall, Mattie, who also volunteers at the Jewish General Hospital\u2019s pathology department, will begin his master\u2019s in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. After that, he\u2019s considering pursuing either a PhD or possibly a double medical-philosophical doctorate.", "\n", "\nHis experience at Concordia will serve him well into this future. \u201cI learned how to deal with stress, how to interact with others, how to study; it wasn\u2019t all academic.\u201d", "\n", "\n", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "\n", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Liz Crompton", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Liz Crompton", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
