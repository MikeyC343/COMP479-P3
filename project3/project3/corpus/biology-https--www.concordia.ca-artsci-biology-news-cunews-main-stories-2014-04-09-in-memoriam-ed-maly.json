MacArthur. After an appointment at Tufts University, he joined Concordia\u2019s Department of Biology in 1975 as assistant professor and was promoted to professor in 1987. He was active in ecological research throughout his career and taught a wide range of courses in ecology and organismal biology. He selflessly shared his passion for science with his numerous graduate students as a Fellow of the Science College, through his regular contributions and participation in the Pointe-Claire science fair, by organizing the aquatic ecology exhibit (annually since 1984), and through his many CEGEP site visits.", "Maly played an important role in the life of the department, serving as graduate program director, associate chair and chair, and as the mentor for the ecology research group. \u201cMy colleagues and I in the Department of Biology are truly saddened by Ed\u2019s passing,\u201d says Patrick Gulick, chair of the Department of Biology. \u201cEd was with the department for more than three decades and taught many of the students who completed degrees in biology during his tenure. He was a dedicated and inspirational professor and colleague who will be sorely missed.\u201d", "\n\u00a0", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Source: ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Source: ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
