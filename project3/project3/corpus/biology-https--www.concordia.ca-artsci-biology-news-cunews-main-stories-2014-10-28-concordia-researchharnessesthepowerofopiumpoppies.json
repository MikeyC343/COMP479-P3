Specifically, they are investigating alternative ways to synthesize drugs like morphine and codeine at Concordia\u2019s Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology.", "Funded by Genome Canada, their research for the PhytoMetaSyn Project aims to develop homegrown medicines that will lessen our dependence on foreign supplies of opium poppies by producing morphine and codeine in Canada. The ultimate goal is to increase the availability of these drugs while driving down cost.", "\u201cRight now, the majority of the opium fields harvested for painkillers consumed in Canada are concentrated in Tasmania, Afghanistan and Turkey,\u201d says research associate Fossati. \u201cLarge pharmaceutical companies have a monopoly on these. The ability to tap into opium poppies in a controlled laboratory environment right here at home, and to produce medicines more economically is what we\u2019re striving for.\u201d", "Fossati and Narcross are hoping that by using a synthetic biology approach to producing painkillers, they can expand the number of drugs available for testing by pharmaceutical companies. Ideally, the result will be drugs with better or different pharmacological profiles that make the medicines more easily absorbed and potentially less addictive.", "The general idea behind this science is to take the genetic machinery (DNA) that results in morphine or codeine from opium poppies, and transfer it to everyday baker\u2019s yeast \u2014 the simplest organism that can support it. Microbes, unlike plants, are quick to grow and are not dependent on external factors such as weather and pests.", "The process is no simple matter.", "\u201cA biochemical pathway is like an assembly line,\u201d says Narcross, a PhD student in biology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying do is to take that assembly line out of opium poppies and put it into yeast. The trouble is, we can\u2019t just ask for the plans. It takes a lot of work to figure out how the plant does what it does.\u201d", "Through collaboration with colleagues at the University of Calgary, they have a sense of what some of these pathways might look like.", "Narcross explains: \u201cOnce we have our own assembly lines set up in yeast, then we can look at how to speed up the process. Which workers are too slow? Is someone trying to do too many things at the same time? Do we need to separate two coworkers who talk too much?\u201d", "According to Fossati, creating morphine is just the tip of the iceberg for potential medical uses of synthetic biology. \u201cPoppies don\u2019t just make morphine. They also make hundreds if not thousands of other interesting compounds.\u201d", "Some of these compounds are known pharmaceuticals such as the muscle relaxant papaverine, the probiotic sanguinarine and the antitumor agent noscapine.\u00a0", "But what about worries that such a process could fall into the wrong hands \u2014 ", "-style \u2014 and lead to the illegal production of heroin?", "Narcross is not concerned. \u201cThis process is extremely complex and the tools necessary to produce these medicines are not widely available. Evidently, their production would come under strict regulations and controls.\u201d", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Christian Durand", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Christian Durand", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
