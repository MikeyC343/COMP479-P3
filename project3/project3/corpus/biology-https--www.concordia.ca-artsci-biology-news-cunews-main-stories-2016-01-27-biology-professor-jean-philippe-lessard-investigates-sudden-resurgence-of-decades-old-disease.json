It seems like this virus is able to switch from one species to the other as long as they\u2019re within that genus.", "The species of mosquito that carry the virus are found in tropical environments all over the world \u2014\u00a0the main one being ", ", which is found in Africa, but also India, South-east Asia, South and Central America, and also a little bit in the south-eastern United States. That seems to be the main vector.\u00a0", " are underway in urban areas to reduce the chance of exposure to humans, and it's worked out in the past. You won't eradicate these mosquitoes, because they're everywhere, but if you reduce their density, you reduce the chance of them transmitting the disease.", "The main problem is that when you bring a new virus into a new place, humans' immune systems are not adapted to it, and the virus takes advantage of this. You get big outbreaks because of that. Eventually, the human body will adapt to it and learn to fight it off.", "In Africa, there's likely a higher rate or proportion of people who are immune. That's what evolutionary theory would say, at least. They're engaged in what we call an arms race, where the virus tries to become stronger and the human body tries to respond to it.", "They've been engaged in that race for about 50 years in Africa, and so there\u2019s some kind of equilibrium that has been reached there. In South America, it's a new phenomenon, so it might take a while before we see that happen.\u00a0", "People are\u00a0\ufeffworried because incidences of the disease are being reported further north, closer to the United States. But if you look at other similar, neotropical viruses like Dengue or Yellow Fever, even though they're carried by the same type of mosquito, the occurrence of these diseases is relatively rare in the United States. This suggests that some kind of climactic barrier exists that prevents the virus from doing well in temperate climates.", "It's not enough just to have the mosquito; you also need to have the right climate for the virus to do well.\u00a0", "The other thing is that, right now the virus is contained within one species of mosquito, ", "and that species is not widespread in the US. If it switches to other species of mosquito, then it could become more problematic.", "This evolutionary switch has not happened yet, and even if it does happen, as it happened with yellow fever and dengue already, it still doesn't mean that the virus will be able to tolerate winter and the drier conditions that we have.", "I think a lot of things need to happen before it becomes a tangible threat in North America. Some scientists have built models trying to predict zones that would be suitable for the Zika Virus. They show that Florida could be a high-risk area.", "But if you look at other neotropical viruses transmitted by the same mosquitoes, you would also predict finding them in the Eastern United States and especially Florida, which is kind of tropical. But you still don't find them.", "Obviously, this particular virus could follow a different evolutionary path and evolve very, very quickly to adapt to both a new mosquito and new climactic conditions.
