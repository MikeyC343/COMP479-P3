Cellularly speaking, ageing progresses similarly in both yeast and humans.

The study showed that it increases the average and maximum chronological lifespan of yeast by 475 per cent and 369 per cent, respectively. This represents a much greater effect than rapamycin and metformin, the two best drugs known for their anti-ageing effects.", "\u201cThese six extracts have been recognized as non-toxic by Health Canada, and already exhibit recognized health benefits in humans,\u201d says Simard.", "\u201cBut first, more research must be done.
