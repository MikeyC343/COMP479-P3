The same switch is doing different jobs,\u201d says Whiteway, who also holds a Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics in the Faculty of Arts and Science.", "\u201cWe think the reason for this is because the yeast that makes bread and wine changed its metabolism to allow it to grow without much oxygen. This led to the pressure that generated the rewiring,\u201d he says.", "Pinpointing differences between bread-making and disease-causing yeasts gives us a picture of how cells can be remarkably different even when they look similar.
