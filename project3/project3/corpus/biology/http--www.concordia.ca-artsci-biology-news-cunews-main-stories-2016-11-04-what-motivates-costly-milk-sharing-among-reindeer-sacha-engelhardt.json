Is this behaviour selfless or self-serving?", "Sacha Engelhardt has spent years studying milk sharing, known as allonursing, while completing his PhD thesis in ", "\u00a0lab at Concordia University.", "Weladji, an associate professor of ", " in the ", ", published his first scientific paper on reindeer in 2002. The northern ungulates have been ", " ever since. His lab studies population ecology, behavioural ecology, biodiversity conservation and welfare of captive wildlife.", "Engelhardt\u2019s work focuses on the advantages that reindeer calves have in a group. Many animal groups share the burden of childcare \u2014 the benefits of babysitting are obvious. But the risks of milk sharing can be greater than the rewards.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a highly costly behaviour,\u201d says Engelhardt. \u201cIt can reduce the amount of nutrients that a mother can provide to her offspring. Lactation is the most physiologically demanding part of mammalian reproduction.\u201d", "Not only that, but he says that this kind of teat-sharing teamwork could lead to the spread of disease.", "\n\u00a0", "So, why would a mother assume the risks just to help someone else\u2019s calf? Engelhardt has exhausted several hypotheses in search of an answer, and he\u2019s still coming up with more to explore.", "\u201cWe have evidence for kin selection, we have some evidence for improved nutrition, we have some evidence for reciprocation,\u201d says Engelhardt. His ", ", published earlier this year in the ", ", suggests that reindeer mothers nurse the calves of their relatives more than others, but these results can vary depending on a study\u2019s design.", "Mothers and daughters that normally stick together for other seasons stay far apart during calving, weakening the idea that this is an activity reserved only for the extended family.", "Engelhardt recently published ", " on how allonursing calves receive better nutrition and gain weight more quickly.", "As his previous research suggests, it may be that the reindeer mothers are not so much sharing their milk as they are trading it. So, a mother would nurse another calf because her own calf has nursed from someone else.", "\u201cWe\u2019re not sure whether or not it is targeted cooperation,\u201d says Engelhardt. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about their cognitive abilities so far.\u201d", "What his most recent research does find, however, is that the reindeer don\u2019t look to return the favour immediately after their calf has suckled from someone else. The chances of reciprocity actually increase over time, and many of these reciprocations happen between pairs of reindeer mothers.", "It\u2019s still unclear if this trading of milk between offspring is a conscious reciprocation of milk, but Engelhardt says he\u2019s interested in further exploring this cooperative behaviour to perhaps determine whether or not it\u2019s intentional.", "\n", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Megan Perra", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Megan Perra", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
