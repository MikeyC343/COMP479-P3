Flow injection was coupled with ICP-OES to minimize the degradation of the sample introduction system (usually made of glass) by the basic samples and also to minimize sample consumption. Different approaches were used including the pre-evaporation technique with an infrared (IR) rope heater. Multivariate optimizations were conducted to find operating conditions maximizing analyte sensitivity and plasma robustness using 5 mg/L multi-element standard solution containing Bi, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Ti and Zn. Under optimum conditions, analyte sensitivities for elevated temperature using IR heater were 1.4 fold those obtained at room temperature.

The final procedure identifies heteroscedasticity through applying an F-test on the LLQ and ULQ replicate measurements, with a success rate >92%. Selection of the weight was found to be best performed through a variance evaluation, with a failure rate <14%, while the partial F-test was ultimately selected for picking the model order.

The goal of this project was to examine various mobile phase modifiers and their effects on the LC-MS detection of lipids present in human plasma using negative electrospray ionization. A cold isopropanol protein precipitation extraction of citrated human plasma was performed. Standard solutions of lipids containing at least on representative of each major lipid sub-class were also prepared. These plasma and standard samples were analyzed using a Waters reversed phase (RP) charged surface hybrid (CSH) C18 column, negative electrospray ionization and Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos high-resolution MS. Three different mobile phase modifiers were examined: 10 mM ammonium acetate with 1 mM acetic acid, 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.02% acetic acid. 0.02% acetic acid showed an increase in signal and coverage, and was found to be the best additive in this comparison. This mobile phase was also compared to 0.1% ammonium hydroxide additive using two distinct approaches on Agilent QTOF 6550 iFunnel MS: (i) post column addition using a dual spray injection system to introduce ammonium hydroxide to the effluent within the electrospray source and (ii) addition directly into mobile phase in combination with pH-stable Kinetic EVO C18 column.

However, cell lysis and sample preparation expose thiols to an oxidative environment, and the resulting oxidation of reduced thiols can skew the measured ratio. To avoid this problem, the reduced thiols can be stabilized by derivatization using reagents such as maleimides. Three commonly used reagents, iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide and (R)-(+)-N-(1-phenylethyl) maleimide (NPEM) were compared for the derivatization of common organic thiols prior to analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). NPEM was found to be the best derivatizing agent with high derivatization efficiency and good derivative stability, but its derivatives eluted in two chromatographic peaks, which reduces precision in quantification. Although pH 7 is considered in literature as ideal for selective thiol derivatization, our LC-MS and/or NMR results show that the reaction also occurred with amine groups, and side reactions were also detected, such as opening of the maleimide ring and derivatization of both amine and thiol groups.

The principle of this method is to compare isotopic pattern libraries of contaminants potentially present in the samples and experimental isotopic patterns to identify molecular formulas. For that purpose, a suspect screening method using ultra performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqTOFMS) was developed using 38 model compounds.

GQs are found in gene promoters and telomeres where they regulate gene transcription and telomere elongation. Though GQ structures are well-characterized, many aspects of their conformational dynamics are poorly understood. For example, when there are surplus guanosines in some of the tracts, they can slide with respect to one another, a process we term G-register (GR) exchange. These motions could in principle entropically stabilize the folded state, crucially benefitting GQs as their stabilities are closely tied to biological function. We have developed a method for characterizing GR exchange where each isomer in the wild-type conformational ensemble is trapped by mutation and thermal denaturation data for the set of trapped mutants and wild-type are analyzed simultaneously.

The importance of intermolecular interactions of steroids for their biological signaling function motivated us to perform a systematic comparative analysis of intermolecular binding in cocrystals of pro and pre. To make such comparative examination possible we designed a computational procedure that generates experimentally inaccessible structures of pre cocrystals without relying on conventional crystal structure prediction algorithms, which would be unfeasible in this case. A detailed examination of the fundamental nature of interactions between steroid and aromatic molecules revealed that the different cocrystallization propensity of pro and pre cannot be attributed to the difference in the distribution of charges over the steroid backbone as has been suggested before.

Extending the versatility of the usage of sulfinate salts can be achieved through the introduction of a protecting group to maintain the sulfinic acid functional group. The pyridine functional group is chosen mainly due to the directing impact on the ortho-functionalization and it can also act as a protecting group. The Pd-catalyzed halogenation with pyridine directed ortho-functionalization provide access to other useful scaffolds.

One goal of this project is to better understand the role of Motif C, the least well characterized motif, in enzyme structure and function. Studying tRNA-NT variants containing amino acid substitutions at E189 and D190 in Motif C, shows reduced enzyme activity. Another goal is to understand how an alteration in Motif A (at R64) restores enzyme activity in those low-activity variants of Motif C. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses suggest no major changes in structure in the variants suggesting that changes caused by the substitutions act locally. Thermal stability is affected in some variants. Kinetic analyses showed no alterations in substrate binding (K", ") for ATP, CTP or tRNA, but a reduction in turnover number (k", ") for the 189 and 190 variants, and an increase in kcat in the position 64 double variants. These data suggest that Motif C may play a role in accommodating and orienting the substrates to promote catalysis.

Using a structural superposition of a homology-based model for the fungal enzyme, and the bacterial GDO template structures, we identified residues potentially involved in catalysis and/or substrate binding based on their positions relative to the bound substrate. We then generated and purified C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variant proteins of A. niger-GDO, with residues Gln-92, His-150 and Asp-162 substituted by alanine, and residue Leu-166 by Ile. We found that, while single substitution variants H150A and D162A are not catalytically active, they are still able to bind gentisate as shown by a fluorescence-based ligand-binding assay. This loss of catalytic activity is not due to altered structural integrity of the variant proteins, as shown by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra similar to the wild type. Furthermore, based on the observed kinetic parameters, we propose that residue Gln-92 is involved in catalysis but probably not in the initial binding of the substrate since its kcat value is 30-fold lower that of the wild type, with a Km for gentisate not significantly changed.

The characterization includes powder XRD, TEM, SEM, FT-IR and TGA for the lanthanide oxide nanoparticles by themselves and solid state diffuse reflectance, luminescence (at room temperature, 200K and 100K) and Raman spectroscopies for both lanthanide oxides with and without the capping agent. Most of the lanthanide oxides nanoparticles present the characteristic narrow luminescence f-f transitions, except for TbO1.81 (pdf [00-075-0275]), a blend of TbIII and TbIV. Terbium (IV) has been found to not present luminescence[1]. Some compounds with the organic surface agent show broad bands related to the organic agent, while EuIII, SmIII and NdIII show f-f luminescence transitions that differ in some peaks in intensity and shape to the ones observed in their corresponding lanthanide oxide spectra.", "[1] C. Young In and S. Youngku, RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 31155", "*Sabri, T. (1); Pawelek, P. D. (1); Capobianco, J. A. (1)", "Photodynamic therapy is least invasive treatment in cancer therapy. The technique requires photoactive molecule \u201cPhotosensitizer\u201d that is activated by light to produce reactive oxygen species which cause in situ cell death. There are two major drawbacks that limit the application of photodynamic therapy. First, the use of high energy excitation light that weakly penetrates tissues, allowing the technique to be suitable only for superficial treatments. Second, poor selectivity of the photosensitizer for cancer cells, as a consequence damaging healthy tissues or cells. Our research utilizes lanthanides upconverting nanoparticles that are excited with lower energy light and emit in the UV,visible and near infra-red region of the spectrum. The advantages of this optical property are that it permits light to penetrate deeper in tissues, and can activate a number of photosensitizers that have different excitation profiles. In order to render the particles suitable for biological applications, and to enhance selectivity of tumor tissues, the surface of lanthanides doped nanoparticles are coated with protein albumin. In addition, the photosensitizer, Rose Bengal, is conjugated to the albumin coated nanoparticles. Thus, the nanoconstruct has a dual effect the production of singlet oxygen, and unique selectivity for cellular uptake by cancer cells.", "*Wyszatko, K. (1); DeWolf, C. (2)", "Drop profile- analysis tensiometry (PAT) of bolaamphiphile SiBA-10 has shown a shift in the elastic modulus when the monolayer is in the presence of subphase containing amines. Specifically, this shift shows a larger elastic modulus achieved at lower surface pressures. It was found that tris (2-aminoethyl) amine (0.1M, pH 10) produces the largest shift, presumed to be evidence for the presence of crosslinking between SiBA-10 and tris (2-aminoethyl) amine molecules. Less pronounced effects were demonstrated by tris (0.1M), ethylenediamine (0.01M), and ethanolamine (0.01M) (all at pH 10), reasoned to still be because of binding between subphase and monolayer, but not necessarily crosslinking. This elasticity data is in agreement with isotherms our group has previously collected for SiBA-10 on these amine subphases. Isotherms of three amino-functionalized lipids HO10, TT10, and TO10 (AFLs) were obtained using a Langmuir Trough. It was found that on subphase consisting of GdnHCl, a known hydrogen bond disruptor, the isotherms of the lipids shifted to higher surface pressure. Mixtures of the AFLs and SiBA-10 molecules in ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 were found to produce isotherms unlike those of either constituent; this hybrid nature is proposed to be due to crosslinking between constituents at high surface pressures.", "For more information, contact Cindy Buonomano, Paola Andrea Rojas Guti\u00e9rrez or Philippe Archambault\u00a0at:", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "More contact info", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "7141 Sherbrooke St. West", "\n Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Research Conference", "About CBGRC", "\n                                                                Location\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Guest speakers\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Organizing committee\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Contact\n                                                            ", "Schedule", "Presentations", "Awards", "Sponsors", "Registration", "fr", "Concordia University", "Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Research Conference", "\r\n                    \r\n                    Concordia.ca\r\n                    \r\n                ", "\r\n                    \r\n                    Faculty of Arts and Science\r\n                    \r\n                ", "\r\n                    \r\n                    Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry\r\n                    \r\n                ", "\r\n                    \r\n                    CBGRC\r\n                    \r\n                ", "\r\n                    \t", "\r\n                    ", "\r\n                    \t", "\r\n                    ", "\r\n                        ", "\r\n                    ", "\r\n                        ", "\r\n                    ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Analytical Chemistry\r\n                ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Al Hejami, A. - Optimizing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for analysis of Ni-based materials in alkaline fuel cell electrolyte\r\n                ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Desharnais, B. - Automated selection and validation of a calibration model through statistical testing\r\n                ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Kormendi, A. - Proposed mitigation of challenges faced in oceanic methane analysis\r\n                ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Monnin, C. - Improving lipidomic analysis of human plasma using acetic acid as mobile phase modifier in negative mode electrospray ionization LC-MS\r\n                ", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                    Russo, M.
