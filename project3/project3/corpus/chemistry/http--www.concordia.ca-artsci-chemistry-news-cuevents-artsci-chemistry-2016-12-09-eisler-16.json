These systems can be reversibly and controllably transformed between several different stable conformations, and will respond to orthogonal stimuli. The synthesis, electronic properties, and switching characteristics of several responsive IIN-containing small molecules will be presented.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Sara Eisler obtained her BSc. from the University of Alberta in 1998. While working for Prof. Rik Tykwinski during the summer months of her final year, she developed a rather unhealthy obsession with alkynes, causing her to stay on in the Tykwinski group to obtain her Ph. D. A post-doctoral position at ETH-Z\u00fcrich in the group of Prof. Fran\u00e7ois Diederich followed, where organic materials chemistry (and alkynes) were set aside to investigate gene transfection vectors. She subsequently moved to Montreal in 2006 to work with Professor Jim Wuest to study crystal engineering. Since joining the faculty at the University of New Brunswick in 2008 as an assistant professor, she has continued to design and synthesize organic materials. In her spare time, Sara likes to drink whisky and practice Ashtanga yoga, although rarely at the same time.", "She is the guest of ", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
