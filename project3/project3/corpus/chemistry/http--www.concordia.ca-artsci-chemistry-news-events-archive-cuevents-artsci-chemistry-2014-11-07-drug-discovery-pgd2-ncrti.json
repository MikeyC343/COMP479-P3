", "In particular, this seminar will focus on approaches employed during the optimization of several chemical series to identify clinical candidates. In the PGD2 antagonist project, strategies to reduce biliary excretion and mitigate the formation of reactive intermediates will be presented. This research led to discovery of the clinical candidate Laropiprant. As part of the NcRTI research program, approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of a novel tricyclic series of HIV inhibitors will be discussed. Taken together, these two case studies illustrate the challenges encountered in drug discovery and the power of chemistry to address important biological questions and human health issues.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
