We have used bile acids, natural amphiphilic compounds in our body, in the preparation of new polymers including hydrogels, dental resins, thermosensitive polymers and degradable elastomers with shape-memory properties. Oligomeric molecular pockets have also been made and are shown to be invertible depending on the polarity of the media.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
