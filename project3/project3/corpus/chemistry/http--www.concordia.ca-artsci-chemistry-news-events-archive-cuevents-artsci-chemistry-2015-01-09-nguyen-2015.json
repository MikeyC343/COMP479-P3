Under such conditions, bacterial stress responses induce protective mechanisms to ensure bacterial survival under stress. My group studies the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and how the stringent response, a conserved starvation and stress response, mediates multidrug tolerance. In particular, regulation of oxidative stress pathways by the stringent response modulates antibiotic lethality, and targeting such pathways may be a novel approach to sensitize tolerant bacteria to conventional antibiotic therapies.", "Dr. Nguyen is the guest of Prof. Dajana Vuckovic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
