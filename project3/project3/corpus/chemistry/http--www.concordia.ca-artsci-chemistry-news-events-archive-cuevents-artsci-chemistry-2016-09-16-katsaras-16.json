They are sophisticated and dynamic machines that perform a diverse array of functions, including selective transport, localization, communication and recognition, to name a few. It is also widely accepted that the plasma membrane is laterally heterogeneous containing nanoscopic regions enriched in certain types of lipids, which have different physical properties from the surrounding lipids [1]. These functional domains, commonly referred to as rafts, have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, including signal transduction, drug uptake, and interactions with pathogens. In recent years, we have used small angle neutron scattering to study nanoscopic lipid domains in model membrane systems [2-4], and more recently in the Gram-positive bacterium\u00a0", "subtilis. Data from these studies will be presented, including evidence for the existence of lipid nanodomains in a living prokaryote system, implying that lipid organization is a feature that has likely evolved over time, eventually becoming an integral property of biological membranes.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simons, K.", " ", " ", ", 569 (1997).", "\n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Heberle, F.
