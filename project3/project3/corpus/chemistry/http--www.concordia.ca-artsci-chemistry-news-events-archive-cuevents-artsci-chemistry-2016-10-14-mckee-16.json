Some of these same proteins expressed in soft tissues undergoing pathologic calcification (like blood vessels) also inhibit ectopic crystal growth.\u00a0 In calcium carbonate biomineralizing systems like inner ear otoconia and avian eggshells, similar proteins likewise regulate mineralization.\u00a0 In addition to peptides and proteins, we also show that calcium carbonate (vaterite) chirality effects can be induced by chiral acidic amino acids.\u00a0 ", "Dr. McKee is Full Professor (James McGill Professor), past FRSQ Chercheur-National, and previously Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (just completed after 17 years) in the Faculty of Dentistry at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\u00a0 He also has a joint appointment in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology in the Faculty of Medicine.\u00a0 Dr. McKee obtained his Ph.D. in Anatomy and Cell Biology at McGill University, and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University (and The Children\u2019s Hospital) in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Boston.\u00a0 Following almost a year at the Forsyth Institute in Boston, Dr. McKee spent 8 years at University of Montreal before moving to McGill in 1998.", "Dr. McKee\u2019s research program focuses on the mechanisms regulating biomineralization in bones, teeth and other biomineralizing systems, and more specifically, on the role of proteins in controlling the growth of calcium-phosphate and calcium-carbonate crystals in extracellular matrices.\u00a0 He also studies pathologic calcification in tissues that do not normally mineralize.\u00a0 His research is relevant to bone and tooth diseases affecting mineralization (the osteomalacias), and to debilitating calcification pathologies seen in, for example, cardiovascular disease (notably atherosclerosis, Monckeberg\u2019s sclerosis and end-stage renal disease), urolithiasis (kidney stones) and arthritis.
