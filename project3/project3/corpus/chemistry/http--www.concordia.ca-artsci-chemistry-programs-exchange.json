Successful applicants will be awarded summer employment in the research group of a RISE group member at one of the participating institutions (not their own), and a small travel allowance. Universities with Coop programmes normally recognise the RISE summer placement as the equivalent of a Coop work term.", "The RISE Group is a collection of scientists at almost twenty institutions in Canada, whose research emphasizes the study of chemical or biochemical reaction mechanisms. While the research interests of the individuals in the group vary substantially, all group members are committed to providing dedicated undergraduate students with opportunities to carry out original research and gain hands-on experience in the use of modern instrumental and other experimental techniques for the study of reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates.", "To find out more about RISE, visit their\u00a0", ".", "Your local RISE representative is:", "Dr. Ottenwaelder\u00a0", "\nOffice: SP 201.19\u00a0", "\nE-mail:\u00a0", "The\u00a0", "(ICE) is a research exchange program that\u00a0offers summer employment opportunities to undergraduate students in chemistry, who will have completed the equivalent of two or three full years of study by the end of the school year in which they apply. We send talented undergraduates to carry out cutting-edge summer research in inorganic chemistry at participating universities from coast to coast across Canada.", "The specific interests of the faculty participants vary considerably \u2212 there is a whole periodic table out there! Projects will range from synthesis and catalysis to materials science to bioinorganic chemistry. The ICE Program will wrap up with a workshop for all participating students and faculty.", "The ICE awards consist of a salary component (set at competitive rates and specified in letter of offer) and a travel allowance. Students should note that these are commensurate with the current value of NSERC USRA student awards. Those universities with Co-op programs normally recognize the ICE summer placement as the equivalent of a Co-op work term. Students are expected to apply for an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) where applicable.", "For further information on the ICE program and links to the faculty participants and their host institutions, visit the ICE\u00a0", "\u00a0For an application form, please download the .pdf from the ICE webpage.
