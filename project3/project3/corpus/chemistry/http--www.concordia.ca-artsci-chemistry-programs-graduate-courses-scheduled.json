We have now solved over 100,000 protein structures using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR. More recently, we have gained a deeper understanding of dynamic aspects of proteins in aqueous environments: how proteins adopt multiple conformations in solution through inherent flexibilities in the polypeptide backbone and amino acid side chains. This course will focus on advanced aspects of the interplay between protein structure, function and dynamics, including the following topics: advanced aspects of protein secondary and tertiary structure; characteristic protein fold motifs; energetics of protein folding and unfolding; protein domain motions involved in enzyme catalysis, protein signalling, protein complexation; experimental approaches to determining protein structure and dynamics (X-ray crystallography, NMR, spectroscopic approaches); intrinsically disordered proteins. As an advanced course, there will also be a major focus on recent literature related to lecture topics covered.", "This new course will provide an introduction to the small-molecule drug discovery process.\u00a0 It will begin with a general overview, followed by focused subsections that flow from early target identification, hit discovery, lead optimization, pre-clinical considerations, up to clinical trials.\u00a0 The course will focus primarily on the rational design and synthesis of drugs that employ multidisciplinary approaches to satisfy a multitude of specificity and safety requirements.\u00a0 There will be a focus on organic synthesis within the special context of medicinal chemistry that illustrates the challenges involved in leveraging the opportunities presented by high throughput, parallel and/or combinatorial synthesis in light of physical limitations imposed by processing large numbers of compounds.\u00a0 Case studies from the current literature will be used to highlight how new technologies and strategies have overcome some of those limitations and will be used to highlight recent innovations in the field. The course will also chart the evolution of powerful techniques from structural research (NMR, X-ray crystallography, and computational modeling) as fully integrated medicinal chemistry tools for modern drug-discovery using examples from the current literature to highlight key advances.\u00a0 This course is intended for a general audience and should be of particular interest to those considering a career in the pharmaceutical industry.", "This course offers a hands-on introduction to the computer\u00a0tools used to\u00a0predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, and to get insight into its function.\u00a0The student will learn modeling\u00a0techniques\u00a0such as sequence alignment, homology modeling, computer visualization, molecular dynamics, and molecular docking.
