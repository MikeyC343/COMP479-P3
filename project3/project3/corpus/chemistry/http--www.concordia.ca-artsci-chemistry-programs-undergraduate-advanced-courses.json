An interaction between two molecules? This course explores weak bonding interactions within and between (organic and biologically relevant) molecules. The emphasis will be on hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-stacking interactions in the broadest sense. Experimental (mostly spectroscopic) and computational (electronic structure calculations and electron density analyses) techniques will be introduced for detection and unambiguous identification of these weak bonding interactions. The material covered is applicable in chemistry and biochemistry alike. The format is lecture plus computer lab.", "\u00a0", "Advanced Polymer Science and Nanotechnology is required for knowledge in polymer chemistry, nanoscience, materials science, and biomedical and polymer engineering. The course will offer introductory polymer chemistry with an emphasis on polymer chemistry basics, polymer synthesis, and polymer characterization. It will also introduce advanced topics in polymer materials chemistry, nanoscience, and biotechnology, including controlled radical polymerization, amphiphilic block copolymers, self-assembly, polymeric nanoparticles, and crosslinked nanogels/hydrogels. Further, their uses for biomedical applications, particularly cancer-targeting drug delivery and tissue engineering, will be discussed.", "\u00a0", "This course will examine the biosynthesis and chemical ecology of natural products from plants, bacteria, and fungi.

The applications discussed will encompass toxicology, forensics, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, clinical chemistry, environmental analysis and biotechnology. Lectures and discussion-style tutorial.", "The life sciences are undergoing an \u201comics\u201d revolution where concentrations, interactions and possible functions of hundreds or thousands biomolecules are systematically interrogated in parallel. One of the major analytical tools contributing to the power and growth of metabolomics and proteomics is mass spectrometry. Following a comprehensive description of the available state-of the-art mass spectrometry tools, this course will survey and critically discuss how these tools can be applied to obtain meaningful and reliable metabolomics and proteomics data. Numerous mass-spectrometry-based applications will be considered, including untargeted metabolomics, lipidomics, shotgun proteomics, quantitative proteomics, protein post-translational modifications, top-down proteomics, structural biology and molecular structure characterization. Lectures only.", "This course presents the concepts, tools, and techniques of modern computational chemistry, and provides a very broad overview of the various fields of application across chemistry and biochemistry. The course is divided into two parts: 1) Molecular structure, which covers molecular mechanics and elementary electronic structure theory of atoms and molecules; and 2) Chemical reactivity, which covers applications of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics techniques to studies of chemical reactions. The applications discussed include organic molecules and their reactions, peptides and proteins, drug design, DNA, polymers, inorganics, and materials. The course includes a practical component where students acquire hands-on experience with commonly used computational chemistry computer software", "This course is intended to provide an advanced comprehension of current topics in research related to understanding protein-protein interactions in vitro and in vivo. Topics will include: Origins and evolution of protein-protein interactions; stable vs. transient interactions and their biological significance; interactomics; structural characteristics of protein-protein interfaces; disruption of protein-protein interactions in drug design; experimental approaches to measuring protein-protein interactions.", "This course is concerned with synthetic strategy and design.
