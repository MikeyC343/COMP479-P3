These impacts, especially those to the front and top of the helmet, are primarily responsible for the high prevalence of concussions and spine injuries.", "Cumulative head impacts that are of a \u2018sub-concussive\u2019 level are gaining increasing scrutiny with the growing research in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Ironically, a football helmet enables players to more willingly sustain head contact because of the protection it affords; a phenomenon called \u2018risk compensation\u2019. Due to the nature of football, removing the helmet entirely from the sport is not appropriate. However, there is no regulation that prevents a football player from practicing blocking and tackling without a helmet to solidify a technique which naturally leaves the head out of contact. This session will present background information and early findings of the HuTTTM helmetless tackling training program.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
