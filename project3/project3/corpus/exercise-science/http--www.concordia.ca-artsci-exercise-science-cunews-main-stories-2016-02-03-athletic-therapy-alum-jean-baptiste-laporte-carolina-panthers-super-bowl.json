Really?", "Well, yes.", "\u201cAs we get closer to the big game, I don't expect anything to change,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cIt's going to be the same. It was the same during the playoffs.

I received phone calls right away, and then there was a minute of silence for people from Paris before every NFL game, with the French flag. That was very special for me.\u201d", "\u201cThen ", " from the game that they signed, that said they played for Paris \u2026 I'll keep them, not as a souvenir of what happened two days before, but of the players, of how great these guys can be.\u201d", "Speaking to Laporte, there\u2019s no doubt that he has a lot of love for his team.
