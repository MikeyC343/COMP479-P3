In this thesis, the task of cluster analysis first involves model selection which helps to discover the number of natural groupings underlying a dataset. This activity is then followed by that of estimating the model parameters for those natural groupings using the expectation maximization framework.", "\n", "\nThis work, aims to address the flexibility challenge of the Dirichlet distribution by introduction of a distribution with an extra model parameter. This is important because scientists and researchers are constantly searching for the best models that can fully describe the intrinsic characteristics of the observed data. And flexible models are increasingly used to achieve such purposes.", "\n", "\nIn addition, we have applied our estimation and model selection algorithm to both synthetic and real datasets. Most importantly, we considered two areas of application in software modules defect prediction and in customer segmentation. Today, there is a growing challenge of detecting defected modules in the early stages of complex software development projects and this makes our machine learning algorithm crucial in driving key quality improvements that impacts bottom-line and customer satisfaction.", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\u00a0", "For more information, contact ", " or ", ".", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
