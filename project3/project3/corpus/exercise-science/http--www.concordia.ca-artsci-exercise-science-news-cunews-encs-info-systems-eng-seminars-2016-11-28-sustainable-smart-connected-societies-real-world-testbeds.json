A cornerstone of this revolution are IoT, Cloud and 5G-based smart systems, which will help tackle problems ranging from supply chain management to climate change. This talk will shed the light on the aforementioned IoT based concepts and will show case Synchromedia CFI Smart ETS Residence project aimed to build a smart edge network for sustainable smart community service. Evolving from the smart edge is naturally next step to unlock vast innovations in a multitude of new applications. Additionally, this testbed is connected to newly acquired Telco datacenters in our ongoing projects with industry, to complete an ecosystem which holistically serves research on a variety of fundamental issues on big data analytics, machine learning, prediction, signal processing, and life-cycle orchestration.", "\u00a0", "Dr. Mohamed Cheriet received M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Pierre & Marie Curie (Paris VI) in 1985 and 1988 respectively.
