Sixty per cent of them report having poor control of their symptoms. Fortunately, new research shows there is a simple antidote: 30 minutes of exercise a day, year-round.", "In a study recently published in ", ", experts from Concordia University, the H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montr\u00e9al and several other institutions* analyzed the exercise habits of 643 participants who had been diagnosed with asthma.", "Results were overwhelmingly clear: those who engaged in optimal levels of physical activity on a regular basis were nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to have good control of their symptoms, compared with those who did no exercise.", "The workout doesn\u2019t have to be strenuous. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about running marathons here,\u201d says ", ", the study\u2019s lead author and a professor in the ", " at Concordia. \u201cJust 30 minutes a day of walking, riding a bike, doing yoga \u2014 anything active, really \u2014 can result in significant reduction of asthma symptoms.\u201d", "Traditionally, people with the condition have been discouraged from exercising because of a belief that it triggers shortness of breath and attacks. Bacon explains that simple precautionary measures can be taken to avoid the discomforts that can be caused by physical activity.", "\u201cThe issue of exercise-induced bronchospasm is real \u2014 but if you use your releaver medication, blue puffer, before you exercise, and then take the time to cool down afterwards, you should be okay,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you have asthma, there\u2019s no good reason not to get out there and exercise.\u201d", "That\u2019s a message Bacon hopes resonates. Within his sample group of 643 individuals, a whopping 245 reported doing no physical activity. Only 100 said they engaged in the optimal 30 minutes a day.", "\u201cThose numbers reflect the population in general,\u201d says Bacon, who is also director of the Centre de r\u00e9adaptation Jean-Jacques-Gauthier at Hopital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Forty per cent of people don\u2019t exercise at all, he says.", "\u201cWe need to keep in mind that doing something is better than nothing, and doing more is better than less. Even the smallest amount of activity is beneficial.\u201d", "It\u2019s something to keep in mind during winter months, when fitness levels tend to drop along with the temperature, and cold air provides another trigger for asthma symptoms.", "\u201cOur study shows that those who were able to engage in physical activity on a regular basis year-round benefit most,\u201d says Bacon. If necessary, he suggests finding an indoor place to move, whether it\u2019s the gym, a staircase or a shopping mall.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all about being creative and finding environments where the cold doesn't become an issue.\u201d", "Could a prescription for exercise be the result of this study? Bacon is hopeful. \u201cIt would be great to see physicians recommending physical activity to patients with asthma, alongside traditional pharmacological treatments,\u201d he says.", "Funding support for this study was provided by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Fonds de recherche du Que\u0301bec \u2013 Sante\u0301, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Michel Auger Foundation of Ho\u0302pital du Sacre\u0301-Coeur de Montre\u0301al.", "*Institutions involved are: H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Montr\u00e9al, Concordia University, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Universit\u00e9 de Quebec en Outaouais, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, and Universit\u00e9 de Quebec \u00e0 Montreal.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
