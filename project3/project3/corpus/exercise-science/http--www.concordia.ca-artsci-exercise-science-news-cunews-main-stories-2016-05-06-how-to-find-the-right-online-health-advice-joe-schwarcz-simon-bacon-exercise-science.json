Helping people to tell the difference between the \"good\" and the \"bad\" information can be really important.", "We wanted our panel to represent a variety of experiences and viewpoints. Our \"headliner\" Joe Schwarcz is a world-renowned\u00a0expert in making science and medical discoveries accessible, and an avid social-media user.
