Essential items have the highest levels of utility while luxury items have the lowest. Weighting penalizes nations less for consuming goods that are more useful and holds populations more responsible for items they consume that are not necessary for survival.", "For example, a region that has a lot of cars should assume responsibility for the emissions used in the production of their vehicles in other countries, especially when producing regions do not have high car-ownership rates.", "\u201cWe must provide an account of emissions that better captures responsibility for emissions and can be used to hold nations accountable accordingly in international policy agreements,\u201d says Horen Greenford.", "\u201cThis boils down to how we tabulate national inventories. By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table \u2014 one that is more robust and has greater considerations of equity.\u201d", "This model could also be used at the municipal level, too, says Horen Greenford.
