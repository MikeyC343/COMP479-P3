Each of them gave different inputs. Some mothers, for example, reported they would want to be able to watch their children in the playground but at the same time relax and have tea or coffee near the chalet.\u201d", "Mainly, though, the design groups determined from the community members' input that they liked what was going on in the park already, De la Llata says. \"That is where the idea of the versatile/flexible platform came from \u2014 a space that is delivered to the community for them to transform, adapt and complete depending on the circumstances and needs.\"", "Jasmine Ali, an undergraduate student in\u00a0", "\u00a0and member of the Groupe NDG design team, says the involvement of the community was a key part of the process. \"It's their park, they go to it, they know more about it than us.\"", "A key idea behind the challenge was to plan the space from within the space itself, De la Llata says, explaining that the participants used ribbons, boxes and other items to delineate where elements of the design would be located.", "\u201cThis methodology, which we call \u2018planning-in-situ,\u2019 is completely experimental \u2014 a method that democratizes urban design and planning. It involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching.\"", "At the end of the project, the Concordia students nominated two of their classmates, Ali and Faizan Jaffar \u2014 to receive internships worth $2,000 each. They\u2019ll work with the borough this summer to develop the park projects.", "\"I'm very grateful for this opportunity\u00a0and looking forward to starting my internship,\" Ali says. \"As for my future plans, I'm looking towards continuing my education and doing a masters specifically in urban design.\"", "\nStudents from Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\u2019s\u00a0", "\u00a0also participated in a separate design charrette. Five teams from UdeM spent a weekend in Benny Library putting together their proposals. The first-place team was awarded a prize of $2,500, while the second-place team received $1,500.", "\n\u00a0", "\u201cThere was a lot of collegial and friendly collaboration among professors from UdeM and Concordia in the planning of the whole exercise,\u201d De la Llata says. \u201cWe had meetings with city officials from the borough. They were very responsive to our proposals and adapted the exercise to suit the different needs of each school.\u201d", "Borough mayor Russell Copeman, a Concordia alum and former associate vice-president of the university, was on hand to award prizes at the special event, held at La maison de la Culture C\u00f4te-des-Neiges.", "The projects presented by the students from Concordia and UdeM are remarkable, said Copeman. \u201cThey fit directly into our vision for the 375th anniversary of Montreal, to support the sense of unity and belonging to all the citizens of our neighbourhoods, and to the common history of Montreal and our borough.\"", "For De la Llata, the experience illustrated the value of collaboration. \"It brings out the best in people,\" he says. \u201cWe're really proud of ourselves, as well as the community members of NDG and CDN, and everybody who participated in this project.\u201d", "\u201cThe spirit of this exercise is that these two public spaces, in which students and members of the community have collectively contributed their ideas, represent the union between two culturally and historically distinct neighbourhoods,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a constructive dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal.\u201d", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Elisabeth Faure", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Elisabeth Faure", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
