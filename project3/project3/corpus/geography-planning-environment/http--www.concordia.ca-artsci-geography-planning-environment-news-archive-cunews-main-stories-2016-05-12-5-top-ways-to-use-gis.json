When one major star did not match any site, he used satellite images to explore the location further.", "The process he used to develop and test his hypothesis involves some very typical and conventional geographic information system (GIS) tasks: the use of map overlays and satellite remote sensing. Satellite images allow us to observe and measure objects anywhere on earth, but interpretations need to be careful and validated.", "The satellite images in this case, for example, revealed a set of geometric structures (e.g. rectangles) under the vegetation canopy. It is hard to attribute these structures to natural phenomena.", "Man-made structures such as the Maya temples could cause such features in the images. But so could old abandoned agriculture fields, for example (or something else). Only a field expedition could give a true validation of this hypothesis, which could become a very difficult and expensive process.", "This is where GIS and remote sensing can play a very important role. For example, if the features were indeed caused by an old agriculture/corn field, satellite images of 5, 10 or 20 years ago could help explain the nature of the observed features. Spatial data and maps of communities that live around that area (if they exist) or maps of agriculture activities in that area would also help us understand whether the features could be caused by recent activities.", "All this information (satellite images and maps) can be displayed and analyzed using free open source or proprietary GIS software.", "\n\u00a0", "The application of GIS has no limitations, as long as we have spatial information (location, location, location!).", "GIS can play a powerful role in assisting scientists, business specialists and community organizations validate hypotheses and communicate information and research from many domains.", "\nGIS helps us to understand places, to detect and understand spatial patterns and to determine relationships between variables over time and space. GIS plays an important role in bridging multiple disciplines, and in enabling collaboration using one platform.", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Angela Kross", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Angela Kross", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
