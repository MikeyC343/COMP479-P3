Squeeze into a corset so tight it could kill you over time? These popular trends of the Victorian age have thankfully fallen out of favor. Now it\u2019s time to let go of one more vestige of that bygone era: horse-drawn carriages.", "The City of Montreal took a step in that direction this week when Mayor Denis Coderre announced a year-long moratorium on cal\u00e8ches \u2014 the horse-drawn carriages that carry people \u2014 mostly tourists \u2014 around Old Montreal. The city\u2019s 24 carriage operators will be reimbursed for the cost of their operation permits, which have been suspended.", "The 56 cal\u00e8che horses who live and work in Montreal have been the subject of fierce debate between tourism officials, members of the public, animal advocates and the horses' owners. This debate bubbles up almost annually, every time a horse collapses in the street, or collides with a car, as was ", ".", "Advocates of the cal\u00e8che industry say that the horses are part of the city\u2019s identity, a source of employment and a draw for tourists. They point to city veterinarians who have reportedly found that the horses\u2019 health has improved since the city has taken measures to regulate the industry over the last few years. These measures include bylaws to \u201cprotect\u201d the horses, like requirements that they not work in above-30 degree weather, and that they rest at least six hours a day.", "But even if these bylaws are enforced, horses can still be worked 18 hours a day in 29-degree heat. Under the law, the cal\u00e8che horses are property, equivalent to the cars with which they share the busy streets.", "Of course, unlike cars, horses are living, social creatures. The cal\u00e8che horses are better thought of as workers, but workers who receive no compensation beyond the basic provisions for their survival. They are workers who are exposed to dangerous working conditions, navigating the traffic, construction zones and exhaust of modern city streets. They are workers who, now unemployed for the year, will hopefully be sent to a refuge rather than a slaughterhouse, as cal\u00e8che operators are threatening.", "The province of Quebec recently passed a bill that defines animals as sentient beings. This bill responds to a cultural shift underway, in which the designations of animals as property are archaic, like the cal\u00e8che industry. Following this bill and the lead of other major cities like Paris and Beijing, Montreal should extend the cal\u00e8che moratorium into a permanent ban, relinquishing a punishing practice that long ago went out of date.", "\n", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Rosemary Collard ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Rosemary Collard ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
