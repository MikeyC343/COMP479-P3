They\u2019ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.\u201d", "Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city\u2019s administration and local stakeholders, including the university.", "In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal\u2019s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets.", "A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.", "\u201cWe understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,\u201d Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.", "\u201cThe goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.\u201d", "The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A.

He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves \u2014 ", "the spaces, because they are the ultimate users.", "De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used.", "Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.", "\u201cModernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn\u2019t very democratic,\u201d he says.", "\u201cThe motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.\u201d", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Jesse Staniforth", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Jesse Staniforth", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
