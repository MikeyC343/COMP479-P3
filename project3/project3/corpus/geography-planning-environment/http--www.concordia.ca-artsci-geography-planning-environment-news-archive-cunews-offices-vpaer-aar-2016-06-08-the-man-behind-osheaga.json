", "Farkas remembers the moment like it was yesterday: \u201cHe was looking at this taped-up poster of his concert we did at the Corona Theatre when I approached him and said, \u2018Hi Mr. Bradley. Do you like the poster?\u2019\u201d", "\u201cI really like it,\u201d Bradley replied. \u201cThat was a great show.\u201d", "After Farkas welcomed Bradley back to Montreal, the singer told him, \u201cI\u2019ve been here before.\u201d", "\u201cYes, you were at Osheaga a few years ago,\u201d Farkas said.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been ", " before.\u201d Bradley then pointed to where the Place des Nations stage used to be. \u201cI played here in 1967.\u201d", "\u201cI was speechless,\u201d Farkas says today. \u201cTo experience that with him right there was beyond cool \u2014 it was a surreal moment, my all-time favourite Osheaga story.\u201d", "As co-founder of ", ", ", ", ", " and the ", " festivals, Farkas has pretty much seen it all. He got his start booking shows while still a student at Concordia.", "\u201cI started with a buddy of mine in the late 1980s. We were very into punk rock and the bands we wanted to see weren\u2019t coming to Montreal very often,\u201d Farkas recalls.", "\u201cSo we started calling up bands and booking them. We did it just to see the bands we wanted to see. The bands would come to Montreal, they\u2019d sleep on our floor and we\u2019d do all the work,\u201d Farkas says.", "\u201cI never thought this would become an actual job, but I co-founded ", " in 1993 and did that for a few years. I had a chance to make a real living at it, and it\u2019s been nonstop ever since.\u201d", "The Hamilton-born, Montreal-raised Farkas is now vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company ", ", which presented \u201c1,300 shows last year from Vermont to Newfoundland,\u201d Farkas reports.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge amount of work. With Osheaga, we have reached the point 11 years in where we have a much bigger office, a much bigger team. ", "But it\u2019s very uniting in terms of business: we are 100 per cent in control of the creative, the production and who we book,\u201d he says.", "\u201cThere are various people in the booking department of various ages \u2014 me being the oldest \u2014 and everybody fights for the bands they would like to see at the festival. It\u2019s a very long process. There are 110 acts on the bill and we want every act to be the best act possible.\u201d", "Farkas recalls: \u201cWe used to sit in a room with a board with band names cut out on pieces of paper and we moved them around in the schedule to find the best order possible. Now we\u2019re a bit more savvy and do it with computers. But we still strategize the same way \u2014 we look at every slot and we really try to gap it so you can catch 10 minutes of this, and 15 minutes of that. I love the idea of people discovering new music and running from one stage to another.\u201d", "The 11th edition of ", ", July 29 to 31, features headliners Lana Del Rey, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead.", "\u201cWe booked Radiohead in Montreal for the first time at the 500-capacity club Woodstock back in 1993,\u201d says Farkas.", "\u00a0\u201cWe were literally doing Nirvana that same night at the Verdun Auditorium and raced uptown to catch the end of Radiohead! That was how you did it back then \u2014 you played a club, then came back to play the next size up.\u201d", "Farkas, a married father of a five-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter \u2014 both of whom are also Osheaga veterans \u2014 credits his years at Concordia for helping him grow his career.", "\u201cI won\u2019t kid you, I wasn\u2019t a great student. I was booking shows on the side and working as a bike messenger,\u201d says Farkas.", "\u201cDid I devote myself to my studies? Nope, but it was important to me and my future to get a degree,\u201d he says.", "\u201cI hate starting things and not finishing them. I got a lot out of it, learnt critical thought, and solidified my way of looking at stuff.\u201d", "Farkas adds: \u201cToday I am living a dream. I remember my father telling me as a teenager, \u2018If you can find a job that you wake up every morning and want to go to, then you\u2019re ahead of 95 per cent of the people in the world.\u2019 And I wake up in the morning and want to go to work every day.\u201d", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u201cIt is hard to choose just 10 favourite moments,\u201d says Nick Farkas. Nonetheless, Farkas did manage to narrow down one fond memory for each year of Osheaga.", " \u201cBen Harper. He was the last act on, and I was standing there in the rain thinking, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe we did this, I hope we get to do it again.\u2019\u201d", " \u201cStanding onstage holding my year-old daughter watching the Arctic Monkeys, while Montreal musician Sam Roberts was doing the same with his daughter.\u201d", " \u201cIggy Pop. Just because. He is so passionate.\u201d", " \u201cThat was the year of Coldplay performing during the fireworks [Montreal International Fireworks Competition]. To see them embrace that moment, that was when I realized we were going to be able to do Osheaga for a long time. Here was one of the biggest bands in the world at the time, and here they were at our festival. It was magical.\u201d", " \u201cWeezer put on an incredible show. And I remember when Pavement performed, somebody in the audience threw a full beer cup which flew through the air without spilling and hit Stephen Malkmus right in the guitar. I was like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 It was a surreal moment.\u201d", " \u201cEminem. That was the year we crossed over to a more mainstream crowd. That was the first year we went three days. We added the Friday because he had confirmed. It was a huge coup.\u201d", " \u201cCalexico because I love them and always wanted them to play the festival.\u201d", " \u201cNew Order because it was great watching people who didn\u2019t know them discover the band.\u201d", " \u201cTwo bands: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and The Replacements. The Replacements are my absolute favourite band of all time and the fact that they re-formed and played Osheaga is a top memory. And Nick Cave, same thing.
