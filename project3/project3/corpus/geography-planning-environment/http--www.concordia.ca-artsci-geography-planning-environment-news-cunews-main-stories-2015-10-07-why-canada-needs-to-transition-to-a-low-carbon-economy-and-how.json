Chief among them is a national tax on carbon. \u201cWe think this is a fundamental one, you can consider it the floor under our feet,\u201d says Potvin. The price of carbon would be identical across all the provinces, something most political parties have been reluctant to endorse thus far in the election.", "SCD wants to see low-carbon electricity across Canada, a goal Potvin says can be achieved by 2035. The group is also calling for this kind of power to become Canada\u2019s major source of energy for buildings, transportation and industry.", "Although some might consider them lofty, Potvin says these targets are possible to reach, adding that in her cross-country presentations to unions, First Nations groups and industry representatives, the goals were met enthusiastically.", "\u201cWhen we launched this document, many people were quite pessimistic, and thinking we would have no traction,\u201d says Potvin. \u201cI ended up giving interviews coast to coast \u2026 and I was always met with the same comment: \u2018Hey, Professor.
