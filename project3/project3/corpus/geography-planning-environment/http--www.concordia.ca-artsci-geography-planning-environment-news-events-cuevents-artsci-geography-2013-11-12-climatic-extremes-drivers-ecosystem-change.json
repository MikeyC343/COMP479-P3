Ecosystems and species are adapted to certain climatic conditions. Extreme conditions of short duration and high intensity are expected to cause disproportionally strong effects. The EVENT experiments are simulating future climatic projections. Partly, we mimic extreme drought, heavy rain, modified frost cycles, partly, we monitor the longterm effects of extreme events at different levels of organization. Ecosystem responses\u00a0 are surprising according to the resilience of important functions and services such as biomass, but also according to the disruptions of successional trajectories. Furthermore, we find that intra-specific diversity may be used for the design of adaptation strategies to maintain key ecosystems under future", "\nconditions.", ". \u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
