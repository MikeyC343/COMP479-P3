Oral histories, recollections of contemporary elders, and terms in indigenous languages all reflect peoples\u2019 responses to such change, especially since the coming of Europeans. Recently people have noted signs of greater environmental change and challenges to their resilience than they have faced in the past: species declines; new appearances; anomalies in weather; and declining\u00a0 health of forests and grasslands. These observations and perspectives are important to include in discussions and considerations of global climate change.", ". \u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
