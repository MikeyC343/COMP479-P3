Since the 1950s, Chinese communist leaders identified acrobatics as a tool of propaganda. However, the extent to which acrobatics could be used to glorify the proletariat and Red Guards was disputed at the peak of the Cultural Revolution.

Nonetheless, an agreement on reviving \u201ctraditional acrobatics\u201d was reached after President Nixon watched an acrobatic performance in Shanghai, and in 1972 a state-run", "\nacrobatic troupe went to the United States to promote Sino-US friendship. Drawing on oral history interviews and archival data, this research reveals how acrobats\u2019 embodied practices, on and off, the stage constituted multiple sites and politics of cultural diplomacy at a delicate moment of the Cold War.", ". \u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
