Such conditions can be found in the Totonac territory in Veracruz, Mexico. By working closely with a local indigenous organization, we have put into practice ecological restoration theory. The organization has received guidance on the establishment of a nursery where native plants will be grown and studied in a 2 ha plot donated by the local government. The socio-ecological system has become resilient through autonomy, social organization and leadership strengthening, and local communities hold themselves responsible for the continuation and long term follow up of sustainable development actions in the region.", ". \u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
