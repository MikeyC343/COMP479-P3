Community mapping is a vital approach and technique that can re-present land, lived experience and wisdom. Bringing together citizens to share knowledge about the places they live, community mapping has a track record of improving community cohesion, increasing democratic participation and engaging youth, seniors and other citizens in planning.", "Come learn more about the power of community mapping on Thursday, November 5. During this free, public event, leaders from communities, Universities and First Nations groups will speak about their perspectives and experiences with community maps. The keynote speaker and response panel will be followed by a Q&A and then an opportunity to mingle with other community mapping enthusiasts at an informal reception in MB 3.130 starting at 8:30 p.m.", "\n", "\n", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
