I focus on how different modes of mobility perform different kinds of spaces, views, and mental maps of the city, how the repetition of the daily routine enacts a personal archive of place, and how the functionalistic commute can be \u201cdetoured\u201d into a meaningful practice. My creative research stems in part from my autoethnographic media practices of navigating the city, and frames the gathering of knowledge as an artistic experience that is integral to my methods of investigation. The commute is a unique and everyday liminal space, one that is ripe for artistic encounters and stories to materialize the city in transformative ways. By explicitly advocating an interventionist practice through mapping and locative art, I hope to contribute to the development of a more engaged commute as a hybrid space of pleasure and surprise.", "This project investigates three different and specific kinds of commutes. The first involves a walk between two very different neighbourhoods that involves crossing the controversial border that is the L\u2019Acadie Fence. I use cultural landscape methods of \u201creading\u201d the built environment with an eye on the material, the social and the historical, as well as a photographic practice that documents and archives my daily journeys around the two neighbourhoods. The second commute relates the experience of city transit as a unique space of performance, both in the everyday ritual sense and as a space of social theatre. The ubiquity of mobile media in transit spaces is also addressed as having the potential to reconnect to one\u2019s surroundings, rather than disconnecting from the commuting routine. Finally, the third commute describes a drive from one city to another in rush hour traffic, combined with a look at Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s chronotope as a method of cinematic analysis, and a way of discerning narratives that build up around the non-places of the auto-commute. This study will then conclude by presenting a framework for the detour as a practice of creative mapping through everyday travel.", "\n", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
