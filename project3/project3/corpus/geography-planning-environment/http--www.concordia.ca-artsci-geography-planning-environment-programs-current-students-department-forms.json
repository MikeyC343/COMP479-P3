The student needs to submit a copy of the two forms and additional relevant material to one of the members of the DEC, which presently comprises Dr. Kevin Gould and Dr. Ted Rutland. DEC approval is required before the research involving human subjects can begin. Students should expect that it will take at least one week to receive a response from the DEC. If students whose research did not originally anticipate involving human subjects change their research plans to then involve human subjects, they are required to complete and submit the forms.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
