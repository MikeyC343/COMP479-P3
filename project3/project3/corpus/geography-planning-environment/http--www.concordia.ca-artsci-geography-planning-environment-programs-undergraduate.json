The questions that geographers ask about places, landscapes, and environments distinguish it from other subdivisions of knowledge. In contrast to the narrow focus of many disciplines, geography is broad and diverse, \u00a0capable of examining interrelationships and interconnections, while stressing synthesis \u00a0as well as the importance of social and environmental justice, and the efficient, equitable and sustainable use of resources.", "The BA Major Urban Studies and BA Specialization Urban Planning are multidisciplinary programmes designed to introduce the students to the processes of planned change in urban environments. Urban Planning provides courses involving field studies, planning projects and the acquisition of technical skills. \u00a0", "Environmental science is the study of the natural and man-made environment. It is a multidisciplinary approach to questions related to life on the Earth, degradation caused by pollution and disturbance, the sustainability of resource use, endangerment of species and natural systems. It provides a holistic perspective on environmental problems by combining the knowledge from various scientific disciplines: geography, geology, biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science and engineering.", "Environmental geography is the branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of climatology, hydrology, biogeography, geology and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. This program draws on courses within physical geography, including a distinctive strand of courses dealing with environmental issues, resources and management. Teaching and learning methods are diverse, ranging from lectures and tutorials through to a variety of practical work in cartography, GIS, remote sensing and statistics.", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "View program information", "View program information", "View program information", "View program information", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Department of Geography, Planning & Environment", "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "View program information", "View program information", "View program information", "View program information", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
