The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and statistical analysis.", "Research in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.
