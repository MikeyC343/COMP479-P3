Contrary to other statistics, as the pair correlation, which are universal (i.e. the same for all Lfunctions), it is believed that the one-level density will differ depending of the \u201csymmetry type\" of the family (unitary, symplectic, orthogonal, even orthogonal and odd orthogonal).", "We study the one-level density for various families of L-functions attached to elliptic curves, using the ratios conjectures as introduced by Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer. From the (conjectural) closed formulas that we obtain, we can determine the underlying symmetry type of the families. This cannot always be done with the classical approach to the one-level density, via the explicit formulas, as results can only be achieved for test functions with Fourier transform of limited support, and the three orthogonal symmetry types are then undistinguishable. But this can be done with the ratio conjectures, with somehow surprising results, shedding new light on \u201cindependent\" and \"non-independent\" zeroes, and the repulsion phenomenon.", "Abstract:", "The 20-th century was a time of proliferation of function-like objects such as measures, distributions, currents, Young measures, etc. Ephemerals arrived by the end of the century from different sources and in different guises.\u00a0 In the probability they were introduced by Vershik and Tsirelson within their theory of \"Black Noise\". In the Partial Differential Equations (especially in the Fluid Mechanics) they came together with paradoxical weak solutions of the Euler equations found by Scheffer, Shnirelman, De Lellis and Schekelyhidi, and others. These solutions start \"from nothing\" (i.e. from zero), and vanish in a finite time. Ephemerals can be described as a sort of functions which are orthogonal to all smooth functions, but being substituted into certain nonlinear partial differential equations as a right hand side, or a boundary/initial conditions, produce a nontrivial solution. So, ephemerals have nothing to do with distributions and similar objects.", "For now, there exist no general theory of ephemerals. All what we have is a number of examples.

With the scenario approach, many DDM, relative to different evolution or passes of the set of the parameters, are solved. This approach is not relevant for decision making for many reasons. It does not even make available a unique optimal decision to implement at the beginning of the planning horizon, because the multiple choices that may result from this kind of sensitivity analysis.", "In stochastic dynamic programming models (SDM), some of the parameters of the underlying deterministic dynamic programming model are assumed to be random. This additional uncertainty induces a distribution of costs incurred or rewards. Without exception, stochastic dynamic models try to control directly or indirectly this distribution via controlling moments and/or quantiles and related criteria such as the value at risk (VAR) and the expected value at risk (TVAR or CVAR). SDM are mainly different from each other by the way the constraints involving random parameters are handled, and by the assumption about the decisions process. Decisions can be taken prior to the revelation of all random data, assumed to be adjustable to the progressive revelation of random data or assumed to be partly adjustable and partly taken a prior to each time period of the planning horizon.", "The objective functions of different SDM are comparable.

For convex conservation laws, the first law of thermodynamics renders the models stable by imposing that the entropy must increase. For non-convex conservation laws, like the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics or of certain thin film flows, entropy growth is not a sufficient criteria to obtain stability. Typically, physicists look for solutions that are limits of a purely diffusive regularization and in that case, the well-posedness has been established through the combined efforts of several researchers.", "\n", "\nIn this talk, we will discuss the well-posedness problem for non-convex conservation laws in the presence of more general regularizations, with particular emphasis on an approach developed by Philippe G. LeFloch of Paris VI. Roughly speaking, we will attempt to study solutions to conservation laws where the rate of growth of entropy, and not just its sign, is determined a priori. We present a class of solutions called splitting-merging that illustrate the inherent difficulties in this problem. Following recent work of the author and LeFloch, we introduce a new definition of total variation that allows one to successfully extend Glimm's techniques to scalar conservation laws, and to some weak perturbations of strong waves in systems.", "I will talk about a teaching experiment on absolute value inequalities, where three approaches were tried: \"procedural\", \"theoretical\", and \"visual\".

As a simple corollary of this new analog of comparison formula, one gets a reciprocity law for conformally equivalent polyhedra, which could be alternatively derived from the Weil eciprocity law for harmonic functions with logarithmic singularities.", "Actuarial sciences are multidisciplinary in nature.

It turns out that the method to investigate\u00a0 many spectral statistical properties of the first model when the size N of the matrices becomes increasingly large can be --almost verbatim-- exported to the analysis of the \u201csmall-dispersion limit\u201d of certain nonlinear waves, where the \u201cdispersion parameter'' plays the analog of the inverse of the size of the matrices.\u00a0Two examples are the Korteweg-de Vries and the Nonlinear Schro\"dinger equations (in one spatial dimension): the link is due to the inverse spectral method introduced decades ago by Zakharov and Shabat, and the much more recent method of the nonlinear Steepest Descent of Deift and Zhou.\u00a0Thrown into this mix are certain century-old special functions (Painlev e' transcendents) which still hold mysteries and are object of open conjectures.", "Consider the motion of ideal incompressible fluid in a bounded 2-d domain. It is described by the Euler equations which, in spite of their deceptive simplicity, are hard to investigate. For the initial velocity field smooth enough, the Euler equations have a unique solution for all time, and it's natural to ask what is its long-time asymptotics. The physical experiments and computer simulations show a nontrivial, counterintuitive picture of a huge attractor in the space of incompressible velocity fields, consisting of stationary, periodic, quasiperiodic and, possibly, chaotic solutions. This picture appears to contradict the conservative nature of the Euler equations; this is similar to contradiction between the microscopical reversibility of the molecular motion and macroscopical irreversibility of thermodynamical processes.\u00a0 I am going to demonstrate the results of computer simulation and physical experiments on the fluid motion, and discuss connections of this problem with analysis, dynamical systems and even topology.", "The symmetric distributions on real line and their multivariate extensions play a central role in statistical theory and many of its applications.

By analyzing the textbooks' discourses, the worked-out examples, the ad-hoc jargon, and the proposed exercises, I will argue that the resulting body of knowledge has little to do with mathematical knowledge.

When a tree has a large number of nodes and edges it can be approximated by a continuum tree whose walk is related to Brownian motion and whose point-process is Poisson.

The problem is known as the twin prime conjecture, and was made precise by Hardy and Littlewood in 1933, who predicted an asymptotic for the number of twin primes up to x. One can generalise the twin prime conjecture to distribution of primes represented by general polynomials (the polynomials being n and n+2 for the case of the twin prime conjecture). For example, are there infinitely many primes of the form n^2+1? In 1988, Neil Koblitz formulated another analogue conjecture, for elliptic curves. For each prime p, let N_p(E) be the order of the group of points of E modulo p. Are there infinitely many primes p such that N_p(E) is prime? This has application to cryptography. This conjecture is still an open question, and there are no example of elliptic curves with infinitely many such primes.

Think of them as transformations of Rn which map spheres centered at the origin into ellipsoids of equal volume placed arbitrarily in the space. If we take an n-dimensional convex body, a ball for example, with the metric inherited from the Euclidean space, its volume is an affine invariant, but its surface area is not. However, there exists a notion of affine surface area which is invariant under affine transformations and there exists a famous affine isoperimetric inequality which relates it to the volume.

The financial approach underlies a dynamic hedging strategy that is not self-financing. This non self-financing strategy is leading to two different types of errors that are due to the mortality risk.\u00a0 A loaded premium that protects the insurance company against this mortality risk is presented.

Aside from well-known applications of multivariate-statistics, it has been of importance in such diverse and interesting physical problems as the statistical theoeyr of hiigh-lying energy levels of large atomic nuclei (Wigner, Byson, 1960's) and attempts at discretixation of the Feyman path integralunderlying 2D-quantum gravity and conformal models (1990's). More recently, connections have also been made with supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and also some quite different problems amenable to similar analysis, such as growth problems in random media, random words, random tilings and random permutations, as well as the seemingly unrelated domain of classical and quantum integrable systems. A key step in understanding these relations is to note, first, that there is an immediate connection with the theory of orthogonal polynomials, which dates back to the work of Stieltjes in the 19th century, and second, that an effective way to study the relevant statistics of the eigenvalues is by varying the parameters governing the measure and support of the spectrum.
