This thesis focuses in particular on a special type of EIAs; the Compound Ratchet (CR). Sellers of this product, such as insurance companies and banks, retain the right to change one of the pricing parameters on each contract anniversary date, with promising not to cross a certain predetermined thresh-old. Changing these parameters can sometimes have an impact on the value of the EIA, which makes them interesting to study, especially when the issuer's changing policy is not clear. In order to reproduce the pattern of these changing parameters, a new approach of dynamically hedging the CR EIA and simultaneously protecting the issuer from hedging risk is proposed and tested.", "Assuming the Black-Scholes financial framework and in the absence of mortality risk, closed-form solutions for the price and value of the CR EIA at any time throughout the contract term are obtained and then used to find the Greeks, which are in turn used build the hedging strategies. In reality, trading can only be done in discrete time, which produces hedging errors. A detailed numerical example shows that the Gamma-hedging strategy outperforms the Delta-hedging strategy by reducing the magnitude of these errors. However hedging risk still exists, therefore, the new approach is applied to transfer the errors from the issuer to the buyer by dynamically changing the pricing parameters. Additionally in the numerical example, the distribution of these parameters is extracted and analyzed, as well as the resulting reduction in the hedging errors, which represent the reduced cost for the issuer.", "This thesis compares the mathematics of engineers with that of mathematicians, and demonstrates how engineers use mathematics in their professional practice.

In addition, a method for two-sample density comparison is proposed, based on the discussed SiZer methodologies. Estimating a single best bandwidth parameter value is difficult. Therefore, all signal detection and comparison approaches utilize the concept of scale-space and color maps, allowing consideration of curve smoothing at multiple bandwidth levels simultaneously.

Using the Euler time discretization for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), Fourier analysis allows to express the conditional expectations included in the time discretization in terms of Fourier integrals. The space discretization of these integrals then leads to expressions involving discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) so that the FFT algorithm can be used. We quickly presents the convolution method on a uniform space grid. Locally, this firrst implementation produces a truncation error, a space discretization error and an additional extrapolation error. Even if the extrapolation error is convergent in time, the resulting absolute error may be high at the boundaries of the uniform space grid. In order to solve this problem, we propose a tree-like grid for the space discretization which suppresses the extrapolation error leading to a globally convergent numerical solution for the BSDE. The method is then extended to FBSDEs with bounded coeffcients, reflected FBSDEs and higher order time discretizations of FBSDEs.

Its payoff at maturity depends on the realized mortality index over the life of the bond, therefore modeling the mortality index is the main concern in our study. Since mortality shocks are detected using outlier analysis, non-Gaussian state space models with a fat-tailed error term is proposed to fit the mortality index and handle shocks. By comparing several state space models with different fat-tailed distributions, an ARIMA process for the baseline mortality and the $t$-distribution for capturing mortality shocks are chosen. We obtain the price of the mortality bond using the proposed model and estimate the market price of risk. It appears that the market of risk is lower than the ones obtained in the literature, which is consistent with the industrial empirical results from Wang (2004). This implies that our model is capable to handle mortality risks.", "Mr. Felix Sidokhine (M.Sc.)", "Previous research has reported on students' uses of mathematics textbooks at pre-university and undergraduate levels. Also, some research has been done on textbooks as standalone objects, looking at their format and didactic and mathematical discourses.

In this thesis we do so at the graduate level; in particular, we investigate instructors' uses of measure theory textbooks. We chose measure theory because of its important role as a foundation for much of what is modern analysis, a branch of mathematics with many applications such as electronics, signal processing and even statistics. We chose the graduate level because textbooks are known to have an important role in the teaching and learning of graduate mathematics courses. In the first part of our research, we draw on Eco's notion of model reader and characterized the target instructor audience of four measure theory textbooks. We also analyzed the mathematical knowledge that these textbooks contain in light of a review of the history of the development of measure theory. Finally, we analyzed the textbooks affordances for teaching from the perspective of Sierpinska's notion of apodictic vs. liberal textbooks.

The Kuga-Satake variety is determined by the singular cohomology of the K3 surface; on the other hand, this singular cohomology can be recovered by means of the weight 1Hodge structure associated to the Kuga-Satake variety. Despite the transcendental origin of this construction, Kuga-Satake varieties have interesting arithmetic properties. Kuga-Satake varieties of K3 surfaces defined over number fields descend to finite extension of the field of definition. This property suggests that the Kuga-Satake construction can be interpreted as a map between moduli spaces. More precisely, one can define a morphism, called Kuga-Satake map, between the moduli space of K3 surfaces and the moduli space of abelian varieties with polarization and level structure. This morphism, defined over a number field, is obtained by regarding the classical construction as a map between an orthogonal Shimura variety, closely related to the moduli space of K3 surfaces, and the Siegel modular variety. The most remarkable fact is that the Kuga-Satake map extends to positive characteristic for almost all primes, associating to K3 surfaces abelian varieties over finite fields. This can be proven applying a result by Faltings on the extension of abelian schemes and the good reduction property of Kuga-Satake varieties.", "(Click ", " to view)", "In this thesis we introduce the minimum flow cost Hamiltonian tour problem (FCHT).

In particular, we present five different MIP formulations which are theoretically and computationally compared. We also develop some approximate and exact solution procedures to solve the FCHT.

The study demonstrated that participants treated with the visual approach were more likely to engage in theoretical thinking than those treated with the other two approaches. In the present experiment, two groups of participants enrolled in prerequisite mathematics courses at a large, urban North American University were taught AVI with the visual approach using two different teaching styles: discursive (permitting and actively encouraging teacher-student interactions during the lecture) and non-discursive (not allowing teacher-student interactions during the lecture). In Sierpinska et al.\u2019s study, the non-discursive style was used in all three approaches (the lectures were recorded and the teacher was not present in person). In the present study, a live teacher was lecturing in both treatments. Another difference was that in Sierpinska et al.\u2019s study lectures were delivered individually to each participant, while in the present study, all participants in a group were treated simultaneously. Therefore, in the discursive approach, not only teacher-student but also student-student interactions during the lecture were possible.", "The aim of this research was to explore the conjecture that the discursive approach is more likely to promote theoretical thinking in students. The group exposed to the discursive approach was, therefore, my experimental group and the other played the role of the control group. The conjecture was not confirmed, but the two approaches seem to have provoked different aspects of theoretical thinking. The experimental group was found to be more reflective, while the control group tended to be more systemic in their thinking.

The first source of difficulties would pertain to a conceptual understanding of what group theory is and what it studies. The second would relate to the modern abstract formulation of the topics learned in a group theory course and the need to interpret and write meaningful statements in modern algebra. To support this hypothesis, the group concept is explored through a historical perspective which examines the motivations behind developing group theory and its practical uses. Modern algebra is also viewed in a historical context in terms of three defining characteristics of algebra; namely, symbolism, justifications and the study of objects versus relationships. Finally, a pilot study was conducted with 4 students who had recently completed a group theory course and their responses are analyzed in terms of their conceptual understanding of group theory and modern algebra. The analysis supports the hypothesis of the two sources.

First of all, we improve the traditional GM (1, 1) model to the GM (1, 1, u, v) model by introducing two parameters: the grey coefficient u and the grey dimension degree v. Then we revise the normal G-ARMA model by merging the ARMA model with the GM (1, 1, u, v) model. In order to overcome the drawback of directly modeling original stock time series, we introduce wavelet methods into the revised-ARMA model and name this new hybrid model WG-ARMA model. Finally, we obtain the WPG-ARMA model by replacing the wavelet transform with the wavelet packets decomposition. To keep consistency, all the proposed models are merged into a single model by estimating parameters simultaneously based on the total absolute error (TAE) criterion.

In cDNA microarray experiments, information regarding gene activity is extracted from a pair of red and green channel images. These images are often of poor quality since they are corrupted with noise arising from different sources, including the imaging system itself. Inferences based on noisy microarray images can be highly misleading. Many noise reduction algorithms have been proposed for natural images. Among these various methods, those that have been developed in the wavelet transform domain are found to be most successful. Unfortunately, the existing wavelet-based methods are not very efficient for reducing noise in cDNA microarray images because they are only capable of processing the red and green channel images separately. In doing so, they ignore the correlation that exists between the wavelet coefficients of the images in the two channels. This thesis deals with the problem of developing novel wavelet-based methods for reducing noise in cDNA microarray images for the purpose of obtaining accurate information regarding gene activity. Two types of wavelet transforms have been used. The proposed methods use joint statistical models that take into account the inter-channel dependencies for estimation of the noise-free images of the two channels. The performance of the proposed methods is compared with that of other methods through extensive experimentations which are carried out on a large set of microarray images. Results show that the new methods lead to improved noise reduction performance and more accurate estimation of the level of gene activity.
