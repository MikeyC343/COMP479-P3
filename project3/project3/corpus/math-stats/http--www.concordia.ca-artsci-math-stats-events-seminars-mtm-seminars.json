Knewton provides each individual student with a unique, continuously personalized learning pathway to achieving proficiency in the core concepts needed for subject mastery. Using techniques that have been compared to those of Google, Amazon, and Pandora, Knewton harnesses the power of data-mining to make granular customizations of learning materials, adapting to each specific student based on their own learning profile.", "In this presentation, we\u2019ll have an exclusive, behind-the-scenes view into the Knewton Adaptive Learning Platform\u2122 and the Knewton Math Readiness for College\u2122 course solution. We\u2019ll also discuss how Knewton addresses low student retention and graduation rates as well as student preparation for first year classes.", "Probability Theory is a branch of mathematics like none other; its non-deterministic nature leaves room for solutions with varying degrees of accuracy and of confidence when establishing the relationship between the theory and the reality of an experiment. As a result, students introduced to such a topic often fall victim to uncertainty and to misconceptions due to the conflict in between their expectations based on mathematics and their intuitions rooted in experience. This study sought to test the efficacy of an approach using specially designed activities focused on a standard coin-flipping experiment and a constructivist method to reconcile the students\u2019 instincts and probabilistic theory. An in-depth analysis of four students obtaining their bachelor\u2019s of education degree in one of two English universities in Montreal revealed a marked improvement in their level of comfort with the subject matter, in their critical thinking, and in the accuracy of their responses. Consequently, there is potential for further exploration and application of similar methods in the field of mathematics education.\u00a0", "Proof is a topic many teachers feel ill-prepared to approach. The talk will explore some of the historical reasons why this is the case and some possible approaches suggested by the research literature on teaching and learning mathematical proof.\u00a0", "The Algebra Project is a national organization that is devising ways to \"raise the floor\" of mathematics achievement. The target population is those students performing in the bottom quartile on state and national tests. The Algebra Project seeks to stimulate a demand for math literacy in the young people themselves. The Algebra Project has developed a cohort model that we predict will stimulate and enable students to pass the mandated tests in mathematics, and to score well enough on the SAT or ACT to enter college, and place into non-remedial mathematics courses. A key component of the emerging model is the development and testing of new high school curricular materials based on common experiences, activities, and dialogs. We will describe the development of the geometry curricular materials, their base in experiential activities, and the dialogs that replace the paragraph-based text of most textbooks. We observe as an immediate effect of these materials: 1. Students are discussing their mathematical ideas with each other. 2. Students want to and enjoy reading the curricular materials and responding to the mathematical problems posed. 3. Students interact in writing with the text, actively commenting on, questioning and reacting to the mathematical meanings in their own words.\u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
