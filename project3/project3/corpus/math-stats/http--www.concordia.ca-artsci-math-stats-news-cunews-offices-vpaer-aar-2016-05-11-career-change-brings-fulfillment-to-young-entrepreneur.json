The professional web-based service connects businesses wishing to boost their online presence with high-quality freelancers that have the skills to make it happen.", "It\u2019s the brainchild of Liverani and husband Mikael Cho. The couple, ages 26 and 29, co-founded the company three years ago along with partners Luke Chesser and Angus Woodman.", "The 1,000-square-metre ground-floor space of this historical building, which has retained the original tile, stone and brickwork, will also house a co-working space and caf\u00e9 when it opens its doors in April 2016.", "\u201cWe have quite a lot of freelancers that are based in Montreal, and we had to get a new office space anyway,\u201d Liverani says. \u201cWe figured, let\u2019s have a physical presence and show what Crew looks like in the real world.\u201d", "As chief operating officer, Liverani helps define new product features, assures quality, sets up team processes, is responsible for hiring, and manages investor relations and the future of Crew.", "Since tripling its staff in 2014 \u2014 the company now employs upwards of 30 people \u2014 she admits that maintaining a good work-life balance is challenging.", "\u201cThere\u2019s always something to do. It\u2019s about finding that time where you can just think, maybe go for a walk,\u201d says Liverani.", "For her, this precious personal time is early in the morning when her Chow Chow dog begs to be taken out for a stroll.", "Staying on top of things takes a lot of self-discipline \u2014 a skill Liverani says she learned during her time at Concordia.", "A lifelong love of math led her to study actuarial mathematics in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Motivated by the challenging and fast-paced nature of her studies, she was dismayed when her first job offered little more than a 9-to-5 grind in a tiny cubicle.", "\u201cWhat I learned in school was very different than what happened when I graduated and went into the real world of working,\u201d she says.", "Disillusioned, Liverani decided to make a career change after just one year in the actuarial field. Meanwhile, Cho \u2014 a designer \u2014 had grown tired of working in an agency and was ready to do something different.", "With a $25,000 investment from FounderFuel \u2014 a Montreal-based startup accelerator that helps young entrepreneurs refine their vision into deliverable products \u2014 the couple co-founded Crew in 2012. Last year, the company raised more than $12 million.", "\u201cIn terms of learning how to start a business, it\u2019s a lot of trial and error and listening to your gut,\u201d Liverani says. \u201cI think a lot of that stuff you can\u2019t get in textbooks.\u201d", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Katelyn Spidle", "Related links", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Katelyn Spidle", "Related links", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
