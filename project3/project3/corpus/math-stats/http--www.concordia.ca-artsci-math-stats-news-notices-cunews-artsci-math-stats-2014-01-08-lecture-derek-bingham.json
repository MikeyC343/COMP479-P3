He first joined the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan in 1999, and then back to SFU in 2003 as a CRC. ", "He has been awarded the 2003 CRM-SSC prize for his outstanding contribution to design and analysis of industrial experiments. He has developed new theoretical and algorithmic methodology for applications with randomization restrictions, robust parameter design and computer experiments. This also includes contributions to Bayesian design and variable selection in industrial applications. His recent work includes experiment design and model selection for investigation of large-scale computer simulators as well as theoretical results for finding multi-stage experiment designs.
