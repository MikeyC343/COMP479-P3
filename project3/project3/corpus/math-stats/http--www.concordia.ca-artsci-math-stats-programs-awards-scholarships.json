At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to Grey Coat School, Westminster, and from there went to Salisbury Training College where she studied to become an elementary school teacher. She taught first at a school in the Scilly Islands, then moved to successively more responsible positions in schools in the County of Surrey. In 1972 she was appointed head teacher of Duppas Junior School in the Borough of Croydon, a low-achieving school situated in socially mixed area. By the time she resigned from this position for reasons of health in 1984, the standards of work by the children at the school in academic subjects, sports, arts and music, had risen to above average levels.", "In 1984 Brenda Carter married and moved to Canada. Unable to teach for physical reasons, she enrolled in a master's program in the history of education at McGill University. At the time of her death on April 12, 1989, she had just embarked on writing up a study of one-room schoolhouses in the province of Qu\u00e9bec at the beginning of this century.", "Without formal mathematical qualifications, Brenda had a strong intuitive grasp of mathematical processes and procedures, and while not a doctrinaire feminist, she very much wanted many more women to find the keen pleasure in mathematics that she had found in it. The Memorial Scholarship was established by her husband, David Wheeler, a Professor of Mathematics at Concordia University from 1975 to 1990, and funded by the generous donations of friends and colleagues.", "David Wheeler was born in UK on February 16, 1925. Through a career extending over 50 years and spent in three different countries (UK, USA, Canada), David Wheeler has made many important contributions to mathematical education at large. He was a professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in Concordia University, where he taught mathematics and mathematics education courses. He was the founder and long time editor of the journal, For the Learning of Mathematics, one of the renown international journals in mathematics education.", "David Wheeler died in Vancouver on October 7th, 2000. One of his colleagues, Mogens Niss, paid a tribute to him in these words: \"David Wheeler was a mathematics educator who never in a fraction of a moment forgot that, from his perspective, mathematics education ought to be provided to human beings, in order to serve their needs as human beings, and with due respect being paid to how human beings are different, and to how they live, feel and think. Hence empathy, open- and broadmindedness, an unpompous sense of reality, and not the least silent humour, should permeate the way we deal with mathematics education. All of these permeated David himself. We have indeed lost a giant in mathematics education, and some of us a dear friend as well.\"", "The Nick Herscovics Scholarship is awarded to a student pursuing full-time studies in the M.T.M. program. The amount of the scholarship is $1,000 and it is awarded based on academic excellence. The award can be held by the same person for a maximum of two years.
