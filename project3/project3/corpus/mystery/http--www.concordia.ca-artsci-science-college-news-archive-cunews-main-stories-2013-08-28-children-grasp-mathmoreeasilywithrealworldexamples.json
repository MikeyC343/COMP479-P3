Wrong. As millions of students head back to school next week, more than half will use exactly that kind of thinking when faced with fractions for the first time. New research from Concordia University shows that for children to understand math, teachers must constantly make the connection between abstract numbers and tangible examples.", "Helena Osana, associate professor in the Department of Education, and PhD candidate Nicole Pitsolantis put this theory to the test in a classroom of fifth and sixth graders. Their findings \u2014 published in the highly regarded journal ", " as well as the ", "show students understand math much more clearly when teachers use pictures and concrete models to demonstrate what fractions actually mean.", "Those connections are even stronger when the model is personally meaningful to the students. Write out \u201c\u00be\u201d on the blackboard and the concept is not so clear. Show kids \u00be of a shoelace or talk about running \u2153", "of the way to school and suddenly they get it.", "Although many teachers already use models when talking about fractions \u2014 for instance, a picture of a pie with slices eaten \u2014 they often put them away too quickly. To prove that the continuous use of models made a bigger impact, Osana and Pitsolantis tried teaching with models for only part of the lesson, and then for the entire lesson.", "They found that students showed much greater understanding when the models were present. \u201cOur study shows teachers should not only include pictures and models while teaching fractions, but also have them side by side throughout the class while continually making clear connections between the concepts and the models,\u201d says Osana.", "The lessons learned from this research project have the potential to go beyond the classroom.", "\u201cThis is something not only useful for teachers but also for parents,\u201d says Osana. \u201cBecause children are studying fractions, parents think they\u2019re not able to help. But they can have positive effect on learning too. Something as simple as writing \u2018\u00be\u2019 out on a piece of paper, then demonstrating what it means to use \u00be of a cup of sugar, or filling up the gas tank until it reaches the\u00a0", "\u00a0mark, then writing and pointing to the numbers \u2018\u2154,\u2019 can really go a long way towards demystifying math.\u201d", "Pitsolantis, who also teaches fourth- and fifth-grade math at Lower Canada College in Montreal, says that the depth of misunderstanding that happens when models are abandoned surprised her. She and Osana are now running tests to determine how teachers can successfully incorporate concrete models into the curriculum for other grades.", ".", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Suzanne Bowness", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Science College", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "Program", "\n                                                                Courses\n                                                            ", "Research", "Student life", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Information for...
