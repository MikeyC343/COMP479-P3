This past year alone, he taught nine.", "Davis, who earned a PhD from McGill University in 2004, is an expert in the field of electromagnetic engineering. He's sometimes hired as a consultant by medical, biomedical or telecommunications companies. While the contracts are lucrative, he says he\u2019d rather be in the classroom.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t teach for the money; you teach because it\u2019s a calling,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAs long as it fits with your life, and you feel that you\u2019re making a positive impact on other people\u2019s lives, you do it. When you stop feeling that, it\u2019s time to ask yourself, \u2018Is there something wrong with what I\u2019m doing? Has the environment changed?\u2019 You have to adapt.\u201d", "Adapting is the cornerstone of Davis\u2019s teaching practice. The veteran instructor, who earned an ENCS Teaching Excellence Award last year, strives to align his curricula with the current demands of industry, and challenges his students to solve the sorts of problems they might encounter in the workplace.", "\u201cCompanies don\u2019t hire an engineer because they already have all the answers,\u201d he says. \u201cAn engineer is something who\u2019s in the tool shed of a lot of companies, and they\u2019re called on when there\u2019s a problem.\u201d", "With the goal of creating a dynamic, interactive learning environment, Davis always includes ample time for questions and discussion in his classes.", "\u201cThe really skilled students have already read the book; they already know what I have to say,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they\u2019re in class for is to fill in the gaps. It\u2019s really during the interaction that the learning occurs.\u201d", "For Davis, the ideal classroom is one in which the learning flows both ways. \u201cIt\u2019s not my great knowledge being shared with the world so much as it is my understanding blending with their understanding,\u201d he says.", "\u201cSometimes the students\u2019 questions, or my answers, are actually developing a new type of understanding. That\u2019s the whole point of this.\u201d", "\n\u00a0", "\u201cGrowing up, I always said that teaching was a job I\u2019d never do,\u201d says Christine Que, a part-time faculty member in the Centre for Engineering in Society. \u201cI didn\u2019t like having the attention on me. Speaking in front of people was a kind of torture.\u201d", "Thanks to Que\u2019s passion for languages, though, that changed. After a few years of working as an accountant, she left her hometown of Vancouver for Quebec City, where she studied French at Universit\u00e9 Laval.", "\u201cI needed a part-time job, and my French wasn\u2019t good enough to get any other kind of job,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one I did manage to get was teaching French at a private language school.\u201d", "Her first class was daunting, but Que quickly got over her shyness and developed a love of teaching languages. \u201cI enjoy the interaction I have with my students, particularly in the smaller classes, where I get to know each of them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helps to motivate them when they know that they\u2019re not just a face in the crowd.\u201d", "Que later came to Concordia to pursue a certificate in Teaching English as Second Language. She followed that up with a master\u2019s in applied linguistics. As a graduate student, she taught two English as a Second Language courses for the Department of Education.", "After graduating, Que was offered a part-time job teaching Technical Writing and Research Methods for Engineers and Computer Scientists, a required class for master\u2019s students in those disciplines who need to improve their English-language proficiency before graduating.", "The course was a major challenge for Que. \u201cThere I was, facing 30 students, and I had no engineering background. It was a high learning curve!\u201d", "She soon adapted, though, and now teaches the course regularly.", "\u201cI like the class because the students really seem to appreciate what you\u2019re doing for them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re a nice bunch who are curious to learn.\u201d", "With her limited seniority, Que can only teach two courses a year at Concordia for now, but she also picks up language classes at McGill University and Coll\u00e8ge de Maisonneuve.", "\u201cI have a pretty busy schedule between the three places, and I\u2019m never bored,\u201d Que says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Next year will mark Pierre Gauthier\u2019s 30th as a part-time instructor at Concordia. He hopes he\u2019ll be at the university for 30 more.", "\u201cI often joke that they\u2019re going to have to kick me out of here,\u201d he says.", "Gauthier, PhD 96, began teaching at Concordia at 22, as a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. \u201cI\u2019ve been teaching like a madman ever since,\u201d he says.", "But that\u2019s not all he\u2019s been doing. For the last 25 years, Gauthier has also held down a full-time engineering job. He now works for Rolls-Royce Canada Ltd. As team lead for the company\u2019s combustion numerical methods group, Gauthier is in charge of the mathematical models that analyze the combustion systems of jet engines used as stationary power plants.", "\u201cI\u2019m very lucky because I\u2019ve got a foot in both worlds, and the two worlds communicate with each other,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything I do at work, I get to teach it here at Concordia.\u201d", "Straddling the professional and academic spheres allows Gauthier to point to the real-life applications of what he\u2019s teaching. That\u2019s a touch his students appreciate.", "\u201cThe age-old question is, \u2018When will I ever use this?\u2019 Well, I can tell them, \u2018I used it this morning.\u2019 Then they pay attention,\u201d he says. \u201cI even bring in parts of engines, sometimes, and say, \u2018The stuff we\u2019re doing today may seem abstract, but we actually use it to figure out something specific inside the engine.\u2019\u201d", "Teaching also allows Gauthier to sharpen his own engineering and mathematical knowledge base. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to the gym every day, in terms of keeping me on top of what I do at work,\u201d he says.", "Gauthier recently became an affiliate associate professor, allowing him to supervise graduate students and run his own research projects with them \u2014 something he had already been doing at work.", "\u201cI\u2019m a proud Concordia graduate, so I try and bring as many Concordia students as I can into Rolls-Royce to do internships and summer work terms,\u201d he says.", "Although most of Gauthier\u2019s courses draw on his mathematics and engineering expertise, he also teaches a course at the School of Extended Learning that provides struggling students with practical tools for success. \u201cWhen I teach this course, I feel I\u2019m really making a difference because I can see a change in them from the beginning to the end of the term.\u201d", "After almost 30 years, Gauthier is committed as ever to his part-time job at Concordia.", "\u201cI want to be here as long as I can keep contributing,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot of fun doing it.\u201d", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Tom Peacock", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Science College", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "Program", "\n                                                                Courses\n                                                            ", "Research", "Student life", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Information for...
