Physics students, for example, may be required to learn about the biological effects of radiation or about the physiology of vision. Biology students may be required to learn about radiation in the solar system or about the mathematical concepts of symmetry. Such courses are not part of the regular science curriculum and are not offered by traditional science departments. We know, however, that the fast-changing nature of contemporary scientific research does not respect the traditional boundaries between disciplines.", "\n514-848-2424 ext.\u00a02595", "- ", "Richard J.
