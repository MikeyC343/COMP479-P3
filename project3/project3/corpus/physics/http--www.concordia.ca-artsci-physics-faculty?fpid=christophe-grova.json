", "Being affiliated to both Biomedical Engineering and Neurology and Neurosurgery Departments at McGill University since July 2008, Dr. Grova investigates the integration of multimodal functional data to study brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic activity. His research project aims at combining multimodal data in order to detect additional information that could be missed by considering each modality individually. His project involves the integration of three promising functional modalities:", "The comparison of EEG/fMRI and EEG/NIRS offers a unique way to address in vivo the question of the integrity of the neurovascular coupling in the epileptic brain. In addition of studying brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic discharges, Dr. Grova is currently applying similar methodologies to study resting state functional connectivity in epilepsy patients. ", "In July 2014, Christophe Grova became  an assistant Professor in the Physics Department and a researcher in the brand new multimodal imaging platform of the  PERFORM centre at Concordia University, while remaining an adjunct Professor in ", ". This new imaging platform of PERFORM is equipped with a 3T MRI, simultaneous SPECT/CT and PET/CT devices, TMS and high density MR compatible EEG. His research projects are about to evolve to incorporate these new modalities, in order to study epileptic activity, but also many other applications in neurosciences including healthy aging, exercise and multimodal analysis of resting state functional connectivity.", "Giovanni Pellegrino, Tanguy Hedrich, Rasheda Chowdhury, Jeffery A Hall, Jean\u2010Marc Lina, Francois Dubeau, Eliane Kobayashi, Christophe Grova,  ", ", ", " (2016) doi: 10.1002/hbm.23191", "Kangjoo Lee, Jean-Marc Lina, Jean Gotman and Christophe Grova, ", ", ", ", vol. 134, pp. 434\u2013449, April 2016", "Christophe Grova, Maria Aiguabella, Rina Zelmann, Jean\u2010Marc Lina, Jeffery A Hall, Eliane Kobayashi ", ", Human Brain Mapping, Volume 37, Issue 5, pages 1661\u20131683, May 2016", "Nicol\u00e1s von Ellenrieder, Giovanni Pellegrino, Tanguy Hedrich, Jean Gotman, Jean-Marc Lina, Christophe Grova, Eliane Kobayashi ", ", Brain TopographyMarch 2016, Volume 29, Issue 2, pp 218\u2013231", "Giovanni Pellegrino, Alexis Machado, Nicolas von Ellenrieder, Satsuki Watanabe, Jeffery A Hall, Jean-Marc Lina, Eliane Kobayashi, Christophe Grova ", ", Front.
