Returning to Quebec was a homecoming; he grew up in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and did his undergraduate work at McGill (1999) before undertaking PhD (2005) research at Cornell. He was drawn to Concordia because of the small size of the Physics Department, and excited by the potential to contribute significantly to shaping its future.", "The CFI grant is crucial to Champagne's work. It will be used to purchase an Ultra-low Temperature Cryogen-free Cryostat for his research group's work on quantum nanoelectronics. As he points out, the apparatus is both literally and figuratively cool. By producing environments that are only 0.3 degrees above absolute zero (about 1000 times colder than ice), \"It now allows us to do the science we want to do, and puts us on par with much bigger research groups.\"", "Quantum nanoelectronics focuses on discovering the properties of the extremely small. Champagne and the members of his research team are interested in examining the group dynamics between electrons at the quantum level because this is \"where the real rules of the universe are hidden.\"", "Unfortunately, they are not easy to uncover.", "Imagine trying to determine the inner workings of a Ferrari engine while it speeds around a Formula 1 track. This is the situation Champagne faces in examining electrons under normal conditions. Even temperatures that would have our teeth chattering are much too hot for his purposes. For him, heat is noise that masks the fundamental way in which basic units of matter interact. The Cryostat will help him slow atoms and electrons down considerably, to unveil interactions that lead to exotic new states of matter.", "The competitive advantage of the machine lies in its construction. Unlike other devices which produce extremely cold temperatures, the new Cryostat will have a closed cooling system; Champagne and his research team will not have to keep topping it up with liquid Helium which - at $10 per litre - can become a grant-eating expense of the order of $50 000 per year. \"Once our machine is in place, we will only be spending money on research,\" not supplies, explains Champagne.", "The primary test vehicle in his lab is a relatively new material, graphene. It consists entirely of carbon in a chicken-wire-like lattice only one-atom thick.\u00a0 As such, it is truly two-dimensional with a huge surface area to weight ratio. With the PCYIAP support, Champagne's team will try to establish that the material can be used as both a storage device and sensor.", "For instance, graphene can safely store huge amounts of hydrogen. However, as Champagne points out, \"The trick is to show that graphene can also release it on command, and this we cannot do yet\". He is examining how stressing the graphene by stretching will reduce the carbon-hydrogen binding energy and release the gas.", "While the research is very fundamental, it may one day provide an answer to our attempts to provide infrastructure for hydrogen-based vehicles. Right now however Champagne says, \"We are only looking to develop proof of concept devices. Once we show something is possible, it becomes an engineering problem, not a science one.\"", "The Ultra-low Temperature Cryogen-free Cryostat will be custom made to Champagne's specifications. As such, he expects delivery in the spring of 2011. With a total price tag of almost $457 000, the device is also being supported by a CFI-matching grant from the Minist\u00e8re de l'\u00c9ducation, du Loisir et du Sport du Qu\u00e9bec, with the balance being supported by other partners.", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Dawn Wiseman", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Dawn Wiseman", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Physics", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Staff \n                                                            ", "\n                                                                La physique \u00e0 Concordia\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Publications\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Champagne Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Bianucci Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Laszlo Kalman Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Zazubovits Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Gauthier Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Grova Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Misra Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Mariana Frank Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Vasilopoulos Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Calvin S.
