Science 101 courses can make or break a student\u2019s decision to venture into scientific fields.", " ", " \u201cThe language, fundamentals and scope of science gateway courses can be akin to a foreign culture,\u201d says Calvin Kalman, principal of Concordia\u2019s Science College and a professor in the Department of Physics. \u201cStudents can have great difficulty reading scientific texts \u2014 even when they are written in their native language \u2014 while also coping with complex knowledge taught by their professor.\u201d", " ", " Since 1995, Kalman has investigated new ways to ease this learning curve. It was his late wife, Concordia English professor Judith Kalman, who made a suggestion that led to his current research and the studies they co-authored. ", " ", " \u201cThe main problem in scientific teaching is that its approach is not holistic,\u201d he explains, noting that high school through university-level textbooks aren\u2019t necessarily consistent and don\u2019t employ user-friendly language. \u201cThey offer layers of scientific results, coming from competing interpretations, deposited during centuries.\u201d", " ", " Kalman\u2019s most recent paper, published in the journal ", ", followed 15 college and university students over the course of a semester. He asked that they practise what he calls \u201creflective writing\u201d \u2014 a process where students digest and analyze assigned readings before classroom discussions and pen their thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting students to wrestle with, rather than to summarize, materials,\u201d he says.", " ", " Students were interviewed three times and asked to describe how reflective writing helped their comprehension of course content. \u201cThey felt that they had to put the information into their own words, which really helped them to understand and refine key concepts,\u201d Kalman says. \u201cReflective writing gets students to initiate a self-dialogue about texts and ask: \u2018What do I understand?\u2019 and \u2018What do I not understand?\u2019\u201d", " ", " Kalman says teaching and learning is most successful when student concepts overlap with their professor\u2019s. \u201cStudents are often looking for basics to pass courses, but that doesn\u2019t engage them,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless they come to class prepared to ask questions, students end up serving time.\u201d", " ", " Kalman\u2019s solutions aren\u2019t radical. He encourages professors to go beyond PowerPoint presentations and lectures to promote critical thinking among students. Because his research could have implications for other fields, he recently obtained a three-year grant of $139,600 from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.", " ", " The funding has allowed him to launch collaborations. He is the principal investigator in studies in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, as well as internationally with peers in Portugal, China and Vietnam. Following a course he delivered at Tra Vinh University last fall, he was asked to supervise a PhD student from Vietnam who will incorporate Kalman\u2019s best teaching practices in his own country. He has similar arrangements with students from China and Egypt.", " ", " Improving science education, Kalman says, is the only way that Canada can remain at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy: \u201cIf students don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re learning they\u2019ll drop out and we\u2019ll lose ideas as well as people who will move our country forward. What this country needs are people who think critically \u2014 who are entrepreneurs \u2014 and that begins with how they\u2019re taught.\u201d", " ", " ", " \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", " \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", " \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sylvain-Jacques Desjardins", "Source: Concordia Journal", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sylvain-Jacques Desjardins", "Source: Concordia Journal", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Physics", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Staff \n                                                            ", "\n                                                                La physique \u00e0 Concordia\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Publications\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Champagne Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Bianucci Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Laszlo Kalman Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Zazubovits Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Gauthier Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Grova Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Misra Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Mariana Frank Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Vasilopoulos Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Calvin S.
