Curious about the way students learn and wanting to further explore the field of physics education, she found Concordia to be the most suitable university for her research.", "Her doctoral thesis pertains to scientific educational theory and focuses on effective ways of teaching physics. \u201cI chose this subject matter because from my teaching experience I found that students often simply memorized equations without trying to understand the ideas behind them,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to change the way they think.\u201d", " ", " Calvin Kalman, a physics professor and the principal of Concordia\u2019s Science College, supervised Huang\u2019s research and has high hopes for her future. \u201cIn every way she has shown herself to be an exceptional student \u2013 very keen and always developing s interesting questions,\u201d he says. \u201cMy interactions with Xiang Huang have been an absolute joy and I anticipate that she will have an extremely successful and fruitful academic career.\u201d", " ", " Her husband, an associate professor of mathematics in China, was in Montreal for her convocation. Together, they will also make a trip to Calgary where Huang has been invited to speak at the annual general meeting of the Canadian Association of Physicists.", " ", " Huang has started looking for a full-time position. Although she\u2019s unsure at this point whether she would prefer to teach physics or continue with research, she remains interested in the scientific educational theory.", " ", " \u00a0\u201cI want students to understand the concepts, to develop their scientific reasoning skills, to change their ways of thinking and learning,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has been the goal of my research at Concordia and this is what I will continue exploring.\u201d", " ", "\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Read about more 2012 Great Grads in the Faculty of Arts and Science", " \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", " \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", " \u00a0", "\u00a0", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sarah Volstad", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sarah Volstad", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
