", " ", " Nanotechnology \u2014 the manipulation of matter on a molecular level \u2014 is a cutting-edge, fast-growing field that offers careers in a wide variety of industries, including forensics, aerospace, medicine, fashion, biotech, and the military. Nanotechnology\u2019s applications are far-reaching: nanoparticles, which are a fraction of the width of a human hair, can help paint last longer, make cement dry faster, reinforce lightweight construction materials and get light-collecting solar cells to produce more electricity.", "Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport (now known as the Minist\u00e8re de l'Enseignement sup\u00e9rieur, de la Recherche, de la Science et de la Technologie) recently granted the three schools $299,500 to implement the joint project, titled", ". ", " ", " The funds will be split between the three schools and will enable Coll\u00e8ge Ahuntsic students to have structured physics labs at Concordia and \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Some of them will be paired up with undergraduate and graduate students to conduct experiments, for which they will receive course credit. Concordia students will gain valuable mentoring experience by working with the Cegep students.", " ", " Physics professor and department Chair Truong Vo-Van is coordinating Concordia\u2019s part of the project, and says the goal is to train the Cegep students through hands-on, structured research projects.", " ", " \u201cInstead of having a conventional approach to teaching, we\u2019d like to introduce them to the various tools used in nanotechnology research, and expose them to different aspects of the research conducted at our two universities,\u201d says Vo-Van. ", " ", " \u201cWe want them to look at the whole picture of nanotechnology and, in particular, the objectives of our research projects, in terms of applications. At Concordia, for example, we\u2019re interested in nanoparticles. We study their basic properties with respect to interaction with light or with different electromagnetic waves and related things like that, because we\u2019re interested in curiosity-driven research. At the same time, we also look at the different applications. We can use nanoparticles to increase, for example, the efficiency of solar cells, which transform light into electricity, and to design new biosensing devices.\u201d ", " ", " The project is also supported by Technologies Nanomundi, a Quebec nanotech company, and NanoQu\u00e9bec, a non-profit organization that fosters nanotechnology innovation related to sustainable economic growth in Quebec.", " ", " \u201cThey\u2019re supporting our project in terms of logistics: they\u2019re organizing student visits to industry for us, because they have a large industrial and institutional network,\u201d explains Vo-Van, who also hopes this project will forge better relationships and cooperation between Concordia and francophone Cegeps.
