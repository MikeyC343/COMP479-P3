Since its inception 30 years ago, the university\u2019s Institute for Co-operative Education has allowed students to take the knowledge and skills they acquire, and apply them in the workplace \u2014 an experience designed to give them an edge in both their career and education.", "Now 24 more students from the Faculty of Arts and Science, mainly in their second year, will be able to take advantage of four new Co-op programs in anthropology, sociology, journalism and political science. The work terms are set to begin as early as May 2014.", "\u201cOne of our mandates is to increase the depth and breadth of experiential learning opportunities for students,\u201d says Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute for Co-operative Education.", "He points to the new programs, as well as the three new professional experience options in physics, computation arts and design, as examples of how the university is supporting students by offering new ways to learn \u2014 and to put what they\u2019ve learned into practice. An added benefit, Hughes says, is that Co-op students also become more engaged with the community.", "The Faculty of Arts and Science was a pioneer in co-operative education when it introduced work-study programs in chemistry and biochemistry more than 30 years ago. Today, all of Concordia\u2019s faculties offer experiential learning programs that see students alternate between academic and work terms throughout the school year.", "Hughes is proud of the training Co-op participants receive. \u201cThey are determined and talented, and offer employers brand-new knowledge and a willingness to learn in the workplace, four productive months at a time,\u201d he says.", "The decision to introduce programs in the four new disciplines was informed by studies of other universities \u2014 including the University of Waterloo, the University of Victoria and the University of Toronto \u2014 with similar offerings, all of which demonstrated measurable success.", "Research was also conducted to gauge interest from employers in Quebec and across Canada. In fact, Concordia was receiving requests for students in these areas even before the new programs were approved last November.", "Jane Fairhurst, Co-op coordinator for the Faculty of Arts and Science, expects potential employers to be impressed by the students\u2019 skills and enthusiasm.", "\u201cWe have a lot of students interested in sustainability and social justice, as well as government, foreign affairs and international relations,\u201d she says.", "To be accepted to the Co-op program, applicants must meet a minimum GPA requirement, submit a letter of intent and take part in a group interview.", "According to business development coordinator Lucia Plescia, the 24 new participants will arrive with an impressive skill set. \u201cOur students are able to perform socio-economic and market research,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are also skilled in communication, and they understand human behaviour\u00a0and the importance of conflict resolution and dialogue in negotiation\u00a0strategies.\u201d", "And often, their abilities go even further: \u201cMany are trained in sustainability. Some have specialized geographic training and a socio-political understanding of specific regions.\u201d", "These facts are not lost on employers. Among those interested in Concordia students for the May 2014 work term are Environment Canada and the Treasury Board of Canada (Ottawa, Ont.); the International Air Transport Association and the Quebec-Labrador Foundation (Montreal, Que.); the Green Timbers Heritage Society Environmental Outreach Team (Surrey, B.C.); Husky Energy (Calgary, Alta.); and BC Hydro (Vancouver, B.C.). Journalism students will be able to take advantage of opportunities at the CBC and Concordia\u2019s University Communications Services office.", "While recruitment for many of these positions will come through the Co-op program, students are expected to search for work as well.", "\u201cCo-op is not a placement agency, but we are here to support students,\u201d says Fairhurst. \u201cThey\u2019re not left on their own.\u201d", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Louise Lalonde", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Louise Lalonde", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Future students", "Student hub", "Alumni & friends", "Parents", "Faculty & staff", "Media", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Physics", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Staff \n                                                            ", "\n                                                                La physique \u00e0 Concordia\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Publications\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Champagne Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Bianucci Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Laszlo Kalman Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Zazubovits Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Gauthier Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Grova Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Misra Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Mariana Frank Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Vasilopoulos Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Calvin S.
