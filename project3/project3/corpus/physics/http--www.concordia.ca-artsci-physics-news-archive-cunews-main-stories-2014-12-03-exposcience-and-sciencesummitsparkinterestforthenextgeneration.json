The stigma can start in school and continue into high school, depending on their teachers\u2019 enthusiasm and their access to resources. That\u2019s why Concordia is involved in several initiatives to dispel this myth by teaching and promoting science to youths through events like summer camps, fairs and tours of Concordia\u2019s labs. The goal is to create an interest in the field, not only for those on a scientific career path, but for any curious student.", "This fall, Concordia held two events committed to the interactive promotion of science: the Science Summit, held on October 24, and Exposcience, which occurred on November 1-2.", "The Science Summit is a new initiative that brought CEGEP students and their teachers to Concordia, where they had the chance to discover what it\u2019s like to research in Concordia\u2019s science labs. They also had the opportunity to conduct guided experiments.", "\u201cFor the Science Summit, science should be read broadly, in that we\u2019re looking to provide opportunities in pure and applied, as well as social sciences and other disciplines,\u201d says Bradley Tucker, vice-president of Registrarial Service.", "Due to growing interest from the CEGEP level, the Science Summit is now looking to expand into placements where college students from the Montreal area could gain experience in Concordia\u2019s labs.", "\u201cThe initiative aims to introduce college students to Concordia\u2019s state-of-the-art facilities. When it comes time for them to choose a university, they\u2019ll be aware of everything we have to offer,\u201d says Tucker.", "Celebrating its 31", " anniversary in November of this year, Exposcience successfully brought together Concordia science students volunteers, young children and their parents. The exhibits and activities are designed to instil in the children an early interest in science and technology. Exposcience also gives Concordia students the chance to positively influence young people while showcasing what they\u2019re learning.", "Behind the event are Miriam Posner and Cameron Tilson, who have both been involved in Exposcience for more than 30 years. They share a passion for teaching kids about science and say the positive feedback they receive is highly rewarding.", "\u201cIt makes me proud to be a Concordian,\u201d says Tilson, the assistant director for Institutional Planning. \u201cAnd it takes me back to my own academic roots in the sciences as a Concordia graduate.\u201d", "Tilson shared the story of a Concordia engineering graduate, now in a successful career in aerospace, who remembered coming to Exposcience in the early 1990s. He believes the event played a large part in both his choice of career and university.", "Posner added that Exposcience is family-oriented and that children and their parents engage in learning with Concordia\u2019s student volunteers.", "\u201cOne can\u2019t help but be energized by the enthusiasm of our students,\u201d says Posner, the technical supervisor for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, \u201cand by the expressions of fascination in the faces of children as they begin to take in and understand science and technology and see that it can be fun!\u201d", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sara DuBreuil  ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Sara DuBreuil  ", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
