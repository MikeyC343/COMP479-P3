But the ability to predict evolution requires (1) a quantitative description of the \u201cfitness landscape\u201d (the genotype-phenotype relationship) and (2) a description of the dynamics by which microbial populations explore this landscape. I will briefly introduce the conceptual and mathematical parallelism between the fitness landscape in biology systems and free energy landscape in physical systems. Then, I will describe our recent work where we showed that the fitness landscape of norovirus escaping a neutralizing antibody can be projected onto two traits, the capsid folding stability and its binding affinity to the antibody. We then developed a theory based on protein biophysics and population genetics to predict how the fitness landscape might be explored. Using a droplet-based microfluidics \u201cEvolution Chip\u201d, we propagated millions of independent viral sub-populations, and showed that by tuning viral population size per drop, we could control the direction of viral evolution. Additionally, I will describe how this combined framework of biophysics and evolutionary biology also applies to bacterial evolution due to horizontal gene transfer.", "\u00a0", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Calendar", "Submit an event", "Latest news", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Physics", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Staff \n                                                            ", "\n                                                                La physique \u00e0 Concordia\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Publications\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Champagne Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Bianucci Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Laszlo Kalman Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Zazubovits Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Gauthier Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Grova Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Misra Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Mariana Frank Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Vasilopoulos Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Calvin S.
