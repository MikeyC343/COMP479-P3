However, on occasion, given rare but re-occurring conditions, it performs an acrobatic feat calling out for our attention.", "Mercury, the most eccentric of wanderers, will be performing such a feat on May 9.", "Like Mercury, the messenger of the Roman gods \u2014 also the patron god of money, luck and thievery \u2014 who\u2019s often depicted wearing winged shoes to convey his speed, Mercury the planet is swift, metallic and can be deceivingly cold.", "At night, temperatures on Mercury can reach -173 C, despite its proximity to the Sun. It is the closest planet to the Sun, the smallest and has the fastest orbital velocity of any planet. Mercury is also known for its high orbital eccentricity (not to be confused with the word \u201ceccentric\u201d \u2014 although somewhat related). Eccentricity is a measure of how much a planet\u2019s orbit deviates from a perfect circle. Mercury is the planet with the most elliptical orbital of them all.", "Another special feature of Mercury relative to us Earthlings is that Mercury is one of two inner planets \u2014 the other is Venus. From our perspective on Earth, inner planets are interesting because they occasionally pass directly between us and the Sun, forming an eclipse of sorts referred to as a planetary transit.", "On May 9, Mercury will pass between Earth and the Sun \u2014 or, as is stated in astronomy-speak, \u201cMercury will pass through inferior conjunction\u201d with the Sun.", "\u00a0", "Planetary transits follow the same physical dynamics as a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the moon passes between the Sun and Earth. For an eclipse or a transit to occur, two conditions must be met: the object (planet or moon) must pass between Earth and the Sun, and the object must intersect Earth\u2019s orbital plane.", "A way to imagine these two conditions, in the case of a solar eclipse, is to think of the moon positioned between the Sun and Earth. Clearly it is not enough for the moon to be in between \u2014\u00a0it must also be high enough along its orbital inclination to obscure the Sun\u2019s rays. This only happens a few times a year.", "In the case of Mercury, there are only two times of the year (May and November) when Mercury\u2019s orbital plane intersects Earth\u2019s orbital plane. At these two times of the year, a transit could occur if, in addition to the orbits crossing, Mercury passes between Earth and the Sun \u2014\u00a0a rare event estimated at around 13 transits in 100 years.", "Like a solar eclipse, viewing planetary transits depends on ", ". Another aspect of eclipses shared by transits is that viewing must be done with care. In the case of a Mercury transit, you would have to look directly at the sun. This could be harmful if not approached with caution. A technique used to avoid direct viewing is to project the image from a telescope or binoculars ", ".", "As interesting as it may be, and as much as Mercury calls for your attention, if you are unable to see this year\u2019s transit (the third Mercury transit of this century), do not despair. You will soon have another opportunity.", "Mercury will continue its flight as messenger to the gods while preparing for its next performance in 2019.", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Mario D'Amico", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Mario D'Amico", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links \u00a0", "Webmail", "Library", "Cspace", " \u00a0", "Calendar - Graduate", "Calendar - Undergraduate", "Class schedules", "Class cancellations", "Course registration", "Important academic dates", "More academic resources", " \u00a0", "Concordia stores", "IT services", "Job opportunities", "Security", "Shuttle bus", "Student Service Centre (Birks)", "All campus services", " \u00a0", "Calendar of events", "Latest news", "Media Relations", " \u00a0", "Arts and Science", "Engineering and Computer Science", "Fine Arts", "John Molson School of Business", "School of Graduate Studies", "All Schools, Colleges & Departments", "Quick links ", "MyConcordia", "Cspace", "Webmail", "Library", "Directories", "A-Z", "Maps", "Concordia University", "Concordia University", "Department of Physics", "About the department", "\n                                                                Faculty members\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Staff \n                                                            ", "\n                                                                La physique \u00e0 Concordia\n                                                            ", "Programs", "\n                                                                Undergraduate\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Graduate\n                                                            ", "Research", "\n                                                                Publications\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Champagne Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Bianucci Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Laszlo Kalman Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Zazubovits Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Gauthier Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Grova Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Misra Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Mariana Frank Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Vasilopoulos Research Group\n                                                            ", "\n                                                                Calvin S.
