Such critical issues can be addressed by developing phosphor-free white LEDs, which, through the direct generation and manipulation of light at different parts of the visible spectrum, will also lead to superior light quality and tunable emission. III-nitride material has been intensively investigated for the use in most of optoelectronics applications, including solar cells, sensors, photodetectors, lasers, and light emitting diodes. However, due to the lack of native substrates, conventional III-nitride planar heterostructures generally exhibit very high densities of dislocations, which severely limit the device performance and reliability.

Coordination with bis-tris propane resulted in a cluster containing at least five manganese ions with potentials ranging from 330 mV to 660 mV between pH 8.0 and 9.4.

High structural quality and promising electronic transport properties have propelled these self-assembled nanocrystalline lead-chalcogenide film structures to the forefront of cutting-edge research in the area of low-cost photovoltaic and photodetector platforms.

However, proteins are almost incapable of light absorption in the visible range which makes them non reachable for direct measurements; therefore, indirect methods should be applied. Pigment embedded into (amorphous) solid can serve as a local reporter on static and dynamic properties of its environment. Using proteins with pigments embedded into them by Nature offers a good alternative to introducing local reporters by chemical or genetic manipulations.

The presence of scatterers in otherwise clean wires can strongly suppress the quantum conductance, and can generate sharp resonances (which are due to quasibound states) if the scattering potential is attractive. These resonances can be either Fano or Breit-Wigner type, depending on the size and/or strength of the scattering potential. Finite temperature effects are also considered.
