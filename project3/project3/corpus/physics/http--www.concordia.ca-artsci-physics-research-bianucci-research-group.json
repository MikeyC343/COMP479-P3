We are setting up a micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) system that will allow us to study the light emission from nanostructures. We can grown our own ZnO nanowires using a solution-based method, in collaboration with ", "\u00a0in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.", "We also use optical microresonators with embedded nanomaterials to how the presence of the material changes the properties of the microresonator and viceversa.", "Photonics is using light to transfer and process information instead of electrons. Thanks to the properties of photons (the virtual particles that carry light), photonics has the potential for creating faster and more power-efficient devices than electronics. One of the building blocks for photonic circuits is the optical micro-resonator, which keeps light confined in both space and time. Micro-resonators are the basis of many photonic devices, such as filters, modulators, delay lines, etc. We are interested in exploring optical micro-resonators with new geometries and materials for creating new micro- and nanophotonic devices.", "The optical characteristics of microresonators, in particular their resonant wavelengths, are very sensitive to changes in their environment. We can use this to make very sensitive optical sensors, which let us measure minute changes in refraction index, concentration, or even the presence of nanoparticles, viruses, or bacteria.", "Coming soon.", "The sharp spectral response of low-loss optical micro-resonators can give rise to significant changes in the group delay of pulses propagating through waveguides coupled to them.
