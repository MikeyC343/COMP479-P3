Using a low-temperature mechanical breakjunction system, we will study their potential as tunable ultra-high frequency nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), and we expect these very short ribbons to have resonant frequencies in the THz range.", "\n", "These NEMS will make very sensitive nanoscale sensors, since even a very small force or mass on the oscillator will cause a shift of its resonant frequency. We also want to use these sensors as laboratories to explore the physics of carbon nanotube and graphene quantum dots.", "Cartoon of electron transport in a quantum dot nano-oscillators", "3D Topological insulators are a family of materials with a band gap but which have an odd number of 2D conducting surface states that cross the band gap at the boundaries of the crystal (See Figure). The word topological refers to the fact that they differ from regular insulators not because of a spontaneously broken symmetry but because of a topological order parameter which is invariant and can only be change if the system undergoes a quantum phase transition.", "\n", "\nWe make electron transport measurements in micron scale 3D topological insulators (TI) to explore the physics of their surface states and the exotic correlated states that they can form when a band gap (mass term) in introduced in their dispersion. These studies are important to develop a fundamental understanding of this new class of correlated electron states, and to develop the potential of these materials as putative room temperature spintronics materials.", "Bi2Se3 micron-sized crystal with 6 photolithographically defined electrodes.

In (b) the crossing CANNOT be removed by moving the Fermi level. Taken from M. Z. Hasar and C. L. Kane, Rev. Mod. Phys.", "In collaboration with the group of Prof. Oussama Moutanabbir (Ecole Polytechnique), we investigate how engineered defects (stacking faults) in silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) affect charge carrier and phonon transport. We study individual Si-NWs grown by the VLS method (Moutanabbir), see Figure, with ordered lattice defect planes along the growth direction. Characterization of the Si-NWs is done by micro-Raman spectroscopy which is sensitive to the presence of crystal faults. Transport and magneto-transport measurements are done at low temperature in single suspended Si-NWs transistors. We are interested in exploring fundamental quantum transport in Si-NW quantum dots, as well as their application in thermal energy harvesting. The thermal conductivity, K, of Si-NWs is lower than for bulk silicon. Defect and surface engineering of Si-NWs can further reduce K, improving the thermoelectric efficiency (ability to harvest energy) to maximizing the figure of merit ZT = (S^2)*sigma*T/K. This would have applications in industry such as improving thermocouples to gather more thermal energy from vapor exhausts.", "Left panel, high-resolution TEM image of a Si-NW crystal\u2019s structure showing stacking faults along the growth direction.
