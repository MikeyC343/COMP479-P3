It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.\u201d", "For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher ", ", worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol \u2014 the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.", "The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue.", "This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered.", "The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable.", "So how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?", "\u201cLots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,\u201d says Chaudhri. \u201cBy modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.\u201d", "She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.", "\u201cThis knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,\u201d says Chaudhri.", "\u201cRat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.\u201d", "Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming ", " annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.", " This research was supported by ", ", the ", " and the ", ".", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
