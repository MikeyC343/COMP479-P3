New Concordia research published in the journal ", " shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.", "\u201cWomen have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in \u2014\u00a0even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,\u201d says psychology professor ", ", who co-authored the study.", "\u201cOur research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.\u201d", "\n\u00a0", "For the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a \u201chormonal profile\u201d questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits.", "The participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways.", "At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end.", "Results were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks.", "That proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks \u2014 such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words \u2014 depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle.", "Essentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.", "\u201cThis is important scientifically. ", " that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,\u201d says Brake.", "\u201cFor example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones\u201d", "For recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study\u2019s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.", "\u201cTraditionally,\u00a0researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants \u2014 and male rats \u2014 in studies to\u00a0develop\u00a0drugs\u00a0and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,\u201d she says.", "\u201cI hope that this study emphasizes\u00a0that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the\u00a0female brain, and that efforts\u00a0must be made to tailor future research to improve our\u00a0understanding of the\u00a0effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.\u201d", "\u00a0", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "\r\n        ", "\r\n    ", "Search for an expert to comment on any topic", "\u00a9 Concordia University"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "By: Cl\u00e9a Desjardins", "Enter a phrase or keyword", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
