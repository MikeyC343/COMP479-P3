They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.", "\u201cWe found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,\u201d says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study\u2019s lead author.", "In particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain\u2019s two hemispheres \u2014 in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.", "\u201cThis suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,\u201d Giacosa explains. \u201cIndeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.\u201d", "Interestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field.", "According to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other. \u201cContrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.\u201d", ", professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its ", ", is\u00a0the study\u2019s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.", "\u201cThis work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,\u201d Penhune says. \u201cUnderstanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.\u201d", "Some studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.", "\u201cRecent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson\u2019s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,\u201d says Penhune.", "The co-authors of this study \u2014 Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J.
