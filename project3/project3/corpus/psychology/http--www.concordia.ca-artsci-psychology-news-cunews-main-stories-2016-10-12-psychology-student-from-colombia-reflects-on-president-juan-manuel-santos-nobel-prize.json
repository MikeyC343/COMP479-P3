However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education.", "When applying to the ", " at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be \u201ca secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.\u201d", "I had the fortune to be accepted into the ", " directed by ", ", who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade.", "This allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia ", " that I got in 2015.

As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution.", "The government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years.", "I have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture \u201cof the moment.\u201d We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face.", "The main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic.
