Outside electives are courses offered in other programs outside of Psychology. You also must ensure you have completed any missing profile courses.

Always bring the completed checklist with you when seeing an academic advisor", "This depends on your degree, the number of credits you need to graduate (90, 108, 120), the number of credits taken per semester, and if you also take summer courses.

If you take 15 credits per semester, it will take you three years to complete 90 credits.", "To be a full-time student in Quebec, you must take a minimum of 12 credits per semester (usually 4 courses). The maximum load is 15 credits per semester (usually 5 courses). If you are worried about the workload that university courses require, we recommend you start out with 12 credits (i.e., 4 courses) in the first semester. If you can handle the workload, then go to 15 credits in subsequent semesters. If you are thinking of applying to Medicine, Law, or Graduate Degrees, then please check with the schools you plan to apply to for the degree requirements (some schools expect you to take a 15-credit to demonstrate that you can handle the workload).", "Psychology courses tend to demand more work from the student than other general elective courses. This is especially the case for courses that have a laboratory component (i.e., PSYC310, PSYC315, PSYC311, PSYC316). While it is possible to take a full Psychology course load per semester, it is not recommended. Instead, taking 2-3 psychology courses, in addition to 1-2 general electives is recommended.", "Given the shorter more compact nature of the summer courses, we recommend taking no more than 6 credits (i.e., two courses) per summer term. Students wishing to receive financial aid during the summer are required to undertake 12 credits during the two summer terms.", "Students will sometimes think they should stay in a course even though they are doing poorly, as they have heard that a DISC looks bad on their transcript. It is ok to have a DISC on your transcript \u2013 this happens from time to time as students like the initial idea of a course, but find it different when taking it.\u00a0 Also, as DISC is better than receiving an F for a course, as a poor grade affects your GPA (a DISC does not count towards your GPA). However, try to not make a habit of having too many DISCs.", "Students can repeat a course at any point, without making an advising appointment.
