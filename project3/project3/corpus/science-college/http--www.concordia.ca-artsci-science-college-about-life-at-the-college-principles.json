Founded in 1979, the Science College espouses the following well-defined, distinct, and important concepts of science education: student participation in laboratory research activities from the first year on and a curriculum emphasizing cross-disciplinary thinking as well as intensive student-faculty and student-student interaction. The Science College accepts as members applicants who show high motivation and potential for excellence. It's academic program complements the regular undergraduate program.", "The following principles underlie the philosophy of the education offered by the College:", "The elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind:", "The Science College is intended to allow a student to become independent, self-motivated, and articulate.
