It also provides an opportunity for students to get together over lunch. The atmosphere is science \u2014 whether it be wrestling with a problem together, talking with a teacher, or proposing a new idea for discussion. This type of social interaction is an all-important factor in the life of scientists \u2014 who spend a lot of their career interacting with others in the field \u2014 and is the best way to gain a real understanding of scientific problems. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, to help each other, and to learn from each other. All are seen as essential ingredients of an education.", "Our\u00a0", "component is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career.
