To qualify for this coveted certification, the university\u2019s actuarial programs had to meet eight criteria including curriculum, graduate count and quality, and connection to industry.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been offering undergraduate actuarial programs for 30 years now, so this is a recognition of the quality of the students we graduate, the graduate education we provide, and the research that is carried out here,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director.", "Schools designated as CAEs are eligible to apply for substantial multi\u2013year education and research grants offered by the SOA, adds Garrido. \u201cEvery year, it\u2019s harder to get funding because of budget and government cutbacks, and there are very few scholarships available for graduate students, especially if they\u2019re international. So this is very good news, both to support our graduate students \u2013 who can apply for extra scholarships they weren\u2019t eligible for before \u2013 and to receive research money for faculty members who want to pursue special projects. It\u2019s exciting to have these new sources of funding.\u201d", "\n", "\nEwa Duma, the actuarial mathematics program director, coordinated the CAE application with the SOA. Concordia had applied for CAE status when the program was launched during the 2008-09 school year, but did not meet the faculty size requirement.", "\n", "\u201cWe hired a new person last summer, so now we\u2019re four professors actively teaching and researching in the program, and that really made all the difference,\u201d says Garrido. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the commitment of the Faculty of Arts and Science that we\u2019ve been able to grow in a way that we now satisfy all these criteria.\u201d", "\n", "\nAccredited programs are more attractive to prospective students, especially those pursuing graduate studies, because of the additional funding sources, he added. \u201cThe SOA has made a tremendous effort to communicate this news about our designation; they sent a press release to all their members worldwide. They are the largest actuarial professional organization in the world. This will also have an impact when we recruit new faculty members.\u201d", "\n", "\nConcordia offers several other programs that have been accredited nationally or internationally:", "\n", "\n\u2022 All engineering programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.", "\n", "\n\u2022 The John Molson School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.
