Also, the lecturer discussed the various stages of his training and how the Science College, impacted on his life to help him become a successful neuroscientist. The speaker described some of the unique stages of his training, which lead a Concordia University undergraduate to become a university professor and neuroscientist. Finally, he discussed some of the recent discoveries that make neuroscience, the science of the brain, one of the most vibrant and exciting areas of modern research.", " He is an alumnus of Concordia University\u2019s Science College. He is a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the Faculty of Medicine, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. He graduated with a B.Sc. from Concordia University and the Science College in 1990. He received a Masters degree from the Universit\u00e9 de Paris, France and a Ph.D. from the U of M in neuroscience in 1994. He then pursued postdoctoral studies for three years at Iowa State University in the USA. In 1997, Dr. Trudeau was recruited to the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and is currently carrying out research on chemical neurotransmission implicating the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. He is exploring some of the normal physiological roles of dopamine in the brain and the pathological implications of this transmitter system. His current research may provide leads to better understand the biology of conditions as diverse as drug abuse, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Dr. Trudeau is author of more than sixty publications in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.", "\u00a9 Concordia University", "Loyola Campus", "\n7141 Sherbrooke Street W.", "\nMontreal,\u00a0Quebec,\u00a0Canada", "\nH4B 1R6", "\n"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
