All the above examples are drawn from the history of the post-World War II science of cybernetics\u2014the study of control and communication in animals and machines. This talk suggests that each example acts out a vision of the world radically different from that of modern science and western commonsense. The talk will explore the politics of cybernetics, suggesting that its aim is an experimental openness to what the world has to offer, rather than a grim quest for domination and control.", "\u00a9 Concordia University", "Loyola Campus", "\n7141 Sherbrooke Street W.", "\nMontreal,\u00a0Quebec,\u00a0Canada", "\nH4B 1R6", "\n"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "\n", "Professor of Sociology at the University of Exeter", " Andrew Pickering began life as a physicist, with his first degree from Oxford and a PhD in particle physics from University College London.
