But this level of stewardship carries with it the burden and responsibility of international leadership in the protection, conservation, and sustainable exploitation of marine biodiversity. Has Canada accepted the responsibility its geography demands? How have fisheries and aquaculture affected Canada\u2019s past and present ocean life, and how might climate change affect it in the future? Biological depredation of waters bordered by the world\u2019s longest coastline ultimately reflects ineffectual leadership and disingenuous commitment to environmental sustainability. Governmental and societal lip service need to be replaced by meaningful responses to over-exploitation and climate change. What can make Canada shift from laggard to leader in sustaining marine biodiversity?", " Following graduate studies at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MSc 1986; PhD 1991), Jeffrey Hutchings worked at Edinburgh University and Fisheries & Oceans Canada before accepting a position at Dalhousie University (1995), where he is Professor and Canada Research Chair in Marine Conservation & Biodiversity.
