While prosthetics already overcome lost function in some areas, they do not promote healing.\u00a0 In regenerative medicine the goal is to promote healing without causing further injury.\u00a0 The promise of regenerative medicine has been realized for skin and cartilage where there are already products on the market.\u00a0 My laboratory is focused on research in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where regeneration is more complex.\u00a0 I will describe two strategies to promote repair, one based on endogenous stem cell stimulation and the other based on stem cell transplantation.\u00a0 These strategies will be described in the context of spinal cord injury, stroke and blindness.", " Dr. Molly Shoichet is an expert in the study of polymers that promote healing in the body.\u00a0 She holds the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Tissue Engineering and is Professor at the University of Toronto.\u00a0\u00a0 She has published close to 400 papers, patents and abstracts and has given over 250 lectures worldwide.\u00a0Dr. Shoichet is the recipient of such prestigious distinctions as the Canada Council for the Arts\u2019 Killam Research Fellowship, NSERC\u2019s Steacie Fellowship, CI", "AR\u2019s Young Explorer\u2019s Award (to the top 20 scientists under 40 in Canada), the CSChE\u2019s Syncrude Innovation Award, Canada\u2019s Top 40 under 40th and the Royal Society of Canada\u2019s Rutherford Memorial Award. In 2008, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the Canadian Academy of Sciences\u2014the highest distinction awarded to a Canadian scientist. She received her S.B. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Chemistry (1987) and her Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in Polymer Science and Engineering (1992).\u00a0\u00a0 She currently leads a laboratory of 25 researchers and has founded two spin-off companies from research in her laboratory.", "\u00a9 Concordia University", "Loyola Campus", "\n7141 Sherbrooke Street W.", "\nMontreal,\u00a0Quebec,\u00a0Canada", "\nH4B 1R6", "\n"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "GooglePlus", "Back to top", "Concordia University", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada", "Montreal", "Quebec", "Canada"], ["Calendar -
